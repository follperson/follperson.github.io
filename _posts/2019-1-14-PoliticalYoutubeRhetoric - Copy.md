There is a literature highlighting the path to right wing radicalization on YouTube, from 
[Cornell](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08313), 
[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html), 
and [The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-youtube-pulled-these-men-down-a-vortex-of-far-right-hate).

I recently had discovered and become a fan of [Contrapoints](https://www.youtube.com/user/ContraPoints), a YouTube 
channel designed to address the arguments and framework that the right had been using to success, from a leftist 
perspective. She found that the left had too little engaging video content online to oppose the cascade of right wing 
youtube video content, especially in a format which engaged disaffected young men. 

With this observation I wanted to see how Contrapoints and leftist YouTubers like her are similar to their
right wing counterparts, especially in the rhetorical composition of their videos. 
Fortunately, I was taking a class on statistical text analysis at Carnegie Mellon, where 
a text tagging software was developed for precisely this purpose:
[DocuScope](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/research-and-publications/docuscope.html).

Take a look at the [report]({{site.url}}/assets/documents/Follmann_TextAnalysisFinal_WriteUp.pdf), or the repositories 
[for analysis  ](https://github.com/follperson/YoutubeDocuscope) or for [scraping youtube transcripts](https://github.com/follperson/youtube-transcript-scraper)
