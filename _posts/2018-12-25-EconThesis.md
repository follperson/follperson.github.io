I spent a semester in undergrad (Fall 2014) working on an econcomics research project, 
trying to review ostensible gentrification in New York City, and any reaction in the cities budget. 
A common theme of those decrying gentrification is that poor, underclass communities are underserved 
by the municipal government, while gentrifying neighborhoods experience reinvestment. 
I took sanitation expenditure as my metric for city investment, and identified how it 
changed over time along with common indicators of gentrification - primarily rising home ownership, 
declining median age, and rising median income. 

Overall, I did not find evidence of city preference for sanitation expenditure due to the primary gentrification indicators, but did find changes according to city zoning characteristics.
