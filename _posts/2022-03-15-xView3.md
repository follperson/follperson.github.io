Back in September-November I lead the TRSS team on the 2021 xView challenge problem from the Defense Innovation 
Unit. The problem was to identify ships from Synthetic Aperature Radar data. 

I dont care to walk through the piece again when there is a formal write up available [here](https://github.com/TRSS-Research/xView3-Release/blob/master/Xview3_Release.pdf).
Suffice it to say, we did well, using a modification of a traditional radar sensing technique, and relatively
established CNN. Thank you [TRSS](https://trssllc.com) for sponsoring the work! it was a privilege.
