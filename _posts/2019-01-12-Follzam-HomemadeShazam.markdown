For our final project in CMU's [36-750 Statistical Computing](https://36-750.github.io/), 
I elected to build an audio fingerprinting software. It's currently only runnable from the command line (or a Python IDE). 
Ideally it would be available as a flask app, with an audio recording functionality through a webpage. 
I may roll out an update to enable this at some point in the future, but it probably won't come until after I've finished my degree.
