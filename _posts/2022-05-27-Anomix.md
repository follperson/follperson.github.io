I finally get to release [anomix](https://github.com/follperson/anomix), the mixture modeling package that I had been working on for several 
months over the past couple of year! Originally developed for a larger project but then scrapped,
I nurtured it and ported it into a stand alone repository for anomaly detection on univariate data!

It supports several distributions and implements MLE estimation where that is well defined, and various other, 
non MLE estimation approaches where not (looking at you Cauchy, Zipf, t-distribution).

It is not massively useful I will admit, but it is pretty handy for its few use cases. It is also a
code project meant to reflect maturation as a developer and data scientist! I have open sourced a general use 
statistical machine learning package on pypi! 

Install it with `pip install anomix`, or clone and build the repo from source! https://github.com/follperson/anomix

Again, thank you to my employer TRSS for allowing me to develop and release 
this project. I hope people use it!
