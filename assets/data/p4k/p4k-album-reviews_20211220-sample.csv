In Lizzy Goodman’s 2017 oral history Meet Me in the Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001-2011, Nic Offer, who’s spent the 21st century hosting party monsters !!! across eight albums and many more singles, talks about looking back. “Each decade pays for the sins of the last,” he says. He’s talking about the way the grunge and rave of the 1990s sought to counter the stadium rock and dance pop of the 1980s with what he called “a new sort of slickness,” a kind of trashy authenticity. Over the years !!! have countered the po-faced myopia of the early 2000s with their own trashy authenticity. They slapped a dad-joke patch on mom-jeans funk to critique the police state with “Me and Giuliani Down by the School Yard (A True Story).” They’ve again and again ordered up the ugliest sleeves that their label, hero-to-all-your-designer-friends Warp, has ever approved. They turned one of the Magnetic Fields’ best songs, a conflicted invocation of MDMA as a psychic and physiological bulwark against homophobic violence, into affable coffee-shop disco, then turned Stereolab’s Marxist-feminist French disko into Brooklyn boys’ noise with a live cover band, Stereolad. They’ve done it all with an accomplished, if ironic, panache. But Wallop begins with a great whooshing sound, like a sort of time travel, and indeed this solid collection is a change of course: a serious embrace of the sounds of the ’90s, an attempt to come to grips with that “new sort of slickness.” Opener “Let It Change U” is a cocky hulk that could’ve waddled onto an early Chemical Brothers or mid-career Beastie Boys album; the titular it is, of course, rhythm. The next track, “Couldn’t Have Known,” cuts acoustic guitars and stuttering breaks into a nod to Akufen’s 2002 barnstormer “Deck the House,” one of the first tracks of the new millennium that, with its kaleidoscopic cut-up of country licks, R&B runs, and a million other bits of cultural detritus, really sounded like the future. Bookends in place, the rest of Wallop fills in the ’90s timeline. “Off the Grid” gathers Liars’ Angus Andrew and longtime !!! co-vocalist Meah Pace for a roiling bit of nihilism. “Get up, it’s here/You’ve got to start to assume/The end is near/And not a moment too soon,” they chant. It’s like Primal Scream covering “1999” in 1999. Like a few other tracks, it dissolves into a dubbed coda (“In the Grid”) that’s just long enough to make you wonder what a No Protection or Echo Dek-style version might achieve, yet not long enough to demonstrate it. But then in crashes “Serbia Drums,” built off a riff drummer Chris Egan recorded while on tour; with its crunchy guitars and DX-7 style bell melodies, it sounds about as dangerous as the dominatrix number in Showgirls. It doesn’t suck. None of Wallop sucks, really, although “Rhythm of the Gravity” duckwalks up to cock-rock with an ostentatious guitar solo and breakbeats that are probably fun live but flatfooted on record. “$50 Million” and “My Fault” are selfies of a funky schmuck who doesn’t deserve these limber party jams but earns them like a salary anyway; the latter boasts a particularly lovely, fluttering synth sound with the exact timbre of empathy. “UR Paranoid” is hyper-tense until detonation and even tenser afterward, as effects drip down the walls of a good house beat and gaggles of vocals chase each other, crying out, “I’m not the one who’s paranoid!” But of course the ’90s were a decade very much in its feelings, and the best parts of Wallop are its most emotional. “Domino” is among the prettiest and most intelligent songs !!! have ever recorded; its delicate investigation of urban planning avoids “Me & Giuliani”’s smugness, building a multi-level argument mirrored by a multilayered sound in debt to IDM. “Slow Motion” has an undertow of a drum loop and a chorus of Offers ruminating on regret while Uzor talks herself into trouble. “Everyone’s a total fucking idiot sometimes, right? Right?” she asks, while icy-hot melodies rise and fall. “When I look back on this moment/Think about hindsight/What am I going to say I was a total fucking idiot about then?” The loop just loops until it loses its will to rise out of a bed of indiscernible chatter. Nostalgia is a killer, but luckily penultimate track “This Is the Door” is one inflatable bootie balloon short of a Lizzo anthem, and a hell of a showcase for Meah Pace. “Maybe you think that I don’t notice/But I do/So I thought I should show this to you,” she sings, her voice casual as if escorting you around her gracious living room while tasteful (and, yes, slick) adult-contemporary pop plays on the stereo. “This is the door.” And you’re out. Horns arrive to celebrate, Pace repeats her breakup line with increasing force to make sure you heard it, and in a few minutes the track has burned better than sage in clearing out the sins of the past.

1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/-ziq-challenge-me-foolish/,2018-04-16T05:00:00,['µ-Ziq'],Challenge Me Foolish,"Following two previous archival collections, Challenge Me Foolish dusts off unreleased tracks from the late 1990s, when the Planet Mu founder was making breakbeat-laced IDM with a strange sense of humor. Unlikely as it may seem today, there was a time during IDM’s heyday when Mike Paradinas’ copious output as µ-Ziq was on par with that of his good mate and one-off collaborator Richard D. James. Through the mid 1990s, the two kept pace with annual album releases and heaps of singles, all shot through with an off-kilter sense of humor. Perhaps if Virgin had properly marketed µ-Ziq’s 1997 album Lunatic Harness, Paradinas wouldn’t have had to take matters into his own hands with his independent imprint Planet Mu. In the 21st century, focusing more on A&R than his own productions, Paradinas had a hand in spreading breakcore, dubstep, and footwork globally, helping to establish the careers of RP Boo, Traxman, Pinch, Venetian Snares, and others. Since the release of his 2013 comeback Chewed Corners, Paradinas has also dug deep into his old hard drives for archival forays like RY30 Trax and Aberystwyth Marine. Challenge Me Foolish could be considered the third entry in this unofficial trilogy. Where RY30 Trax dates back to 1995 and Aberystwyth Marine covers the two years between Lunatic Harness and Royal Astronomy, Foolish culls tracks from 1998 and 1999, right as he was finishing Astronomy and Planet Mu was taking form. It was a heady time for Paradinas, who was drawing on rapid-fire IDM, breakbeats, and even English folk music. Unlike James, Paradinas also mixed in a hefty dose of American hip-hop, weaving all of it together at a furious pace. He recently said that he recorded as much as he could in those days, often a track or two a day, and a sense of redundancy shows. The wincing Ren Faire melodies from Astronomy (like “Gruber’s Mandolin”) return as Paradinas pulls the green tights on again for tracks like “Robin Hood Gate” and “Perfame,” and 20 years in mothballs hasn’t made them any less annoying. But in the intervening years, breakbeats have become fashionable again, so a dusted-off track like “Undone” doesn’t sound quite as dated, with Paradinas playfully bouncing between tympani boom, percolator bip, and dramatic background strings. The snare drum swagger of “Playbox” reminds us that he always had a knack for balancing between IDM and hip-hop breaks. But “Bassbins” also shows that the more aggro and cartoonish take on it (which anticipated the rise of breakcore) remains out of fashion for good reason. The Japanese vocalist Kazumi, who featured on the Royal Astronomy highlights “The Fear” and “Goodbye, Goodbye,” reappears on five of the album’s 14 tracks. Paradinas stretches and warps her voice into an array of shapes—though as is his wont, even that becomes overkill. For the drill ‘n’ bass dizziness of “Lexicon,” Kazumi’s coos get buried under a rockslide of goofball drums and chipmunk-fast vocal chirps. Same when he speeds up the “Amen” break, only to dump it atop her dulcet vocals on “Sad Inlay.” But Paradinas is more playful in chopping up her doo-dahs on “DoDaDu,” and the loungey “Durian” imagines what a µ-Ziq remix of Stereolab or Pizzicato Five might have sounded like back in the late ’90s. On the title track, Kazumi’s voice echoes against a spare, queasy backdrop, for once not overcrowding the song’s space. It’s a rare instance of Paradinas exercising restraint—and all the more effective for it.",µ-Ziq: Challenge Me Foolish Album Review | Pitchfork,5.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
2,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/03-greedo-god-level/,2018-07-05T05:00:00,['03 Greedo'],God Level,"The Los Angeles rapper’s final album before his 20-year sentence is anxious, forlorn, and self-assured—the violence simmers just below its cool and breezy surface. As of this June, 03 Greedo is a ward of the Potter County Sheriff’s Department. The State of Texas expects that, for the next 20 years, one of Los Angeles’ most celebrated rappers will be a resident of a shared pod at a detention center in Amarillo. For the duration of Greedo’s stay, the lights will come on at 4:30 a.m. every morning, his small cache of personal items must fit in a rectangular plastic box, and, though he has a purple grape cluster tattooed beside his left eye, his outfit will be a particularly carceral tone of orange. In the eyes of the law, this is just punishment for possession of a controlled substance and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. In the estimation of anyone with a sense of proportionality, this is a miscarriage of justice. There are many 03 Greedo albums awaiting release, but God Level was his final testimony before a long sojourn. In the days before his surrender, Greedo performed with a frantic regularity, proposed to his girlfriend on-stage (she said yes), dined at a Beverly Hills steakhouse with daughter Meilani, and released his latest tome, God Level. Like his other six albums—he’s very adamant that they’re not mixtapes—God Level is a snapshot of his life in a precise, fleeting moment. It’s him, reckoning with incarceration, desperately supping every last ounce of fame, fortune, and sex before the cup, once overflowing, is snatched away. It’s anxious, forlorn, self-assured, lustful, vulnerable and unrepentant. Greedo’s honesty is revelatory and, in the sense that every rap fan has some yearning for lyrics to have real-life ballast, it’s exciting. But the seeming absence of fictive storytelling can shade his work with horrifying and saddening hues. When Greedo asks his wife if she’ll mail him photos while he’s imprisoned, that isn’t a hypothetical request—basic privations are his new reality (“Bacc to Jail”). He doesn’t sensationalize his adolescent practice of bringing guns and drugs to school—he doesn’t have to (“Street Life”). And, when on “Basehead” he claims, in his nasal, Miles Davis-overblowing-voice, that he bought his first gun from a basehead? Well, that’s probably true, too. But verisimilitude is only part of what makes folks croon Greedo’s songs. They sing because when confronted by an artist with a touched-by-god intuition for catchy choruses and hooks, it’s hard to remain silent. And, on God Level, Greedo has some of his most polished pop moments to date. “Dibiase” has the languid sway of green-yellow palm fronds; “Conscience” is a filigree of soul-baring lyrics about his deceased best friend, Paul “Lil Money” Reed, backed by a golden instrumental; “100 100 100” is a spring shower of royal purple raindrops. But it’s the aspirational “Floating,” with its honking, mumbled chorus, that’s the climax of God Level. It epitomizes Greedo: unhurried and confident, with violence simmering just below its cool and breezy surface. Like every Greedo album save the 13-song First Night Out, God Level suffers from mild bloat. With 27 songs clocking in at a generous hour and 40 minutes, the album is too long and, in parts, too unpolished to be fully immersive. While his prolificacy is impressive, in overstuffing his albums he occasionally draws some of the listener's’ attention away from the remarkable to the merely passable. But of all the tragedies to befall Greedo—and of all the tragedies he may have caused—the possibility that he may never generate a singular, masterful project seems a minor concern. For the past two years, the precariousness of his life has determined the tenor of his career. His first effort as 03 Greedo, Purple Summer, was released less than a month after the Texas arrest which led to his recent incarceration, and subsequent albums were recorded while on the lam from bounty hunters (Purple Summer 03: Purple Hearted Soldier), after death of Lil Money (Money Changes Everything), and on his first night in Los Angeles after being caught by said bounty hunters (the aforementioned First Night Out). The clang of that arrest on a barren stretch of I-40 still resonates, and God Level is just one of its echoes. It isn’t 03 Greedo’s magnum opus. But until he’s free of the deprivations of an unconcerned carceral state, it’s close enough.",03 Greedo: God Level Album Review | Pitchfork,8.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/03-greedo-kenny-beats-netflix-and-deal/,2019-12-05T06:00:00,"['03 Greedo', 'Kenny Beats']",Netflix & Deal,"The incarcerated Watts rapper’s latest is a loosely movie-themed collaboration with producer-of-the-moment Kenny Beats. As 03 Greedo’s 20-year prison bid continues, so too does his bid to remain relevant. He stashed a lot of music away in anticipation of a long hibernation, and his latest is Netflix & Deal, a 13-track collaborative tape with rising producer Kenny Beats. Greedo said that the project is based on movies he watched while he was dealing, and you only have to be half-paying attention to know he meant that literally. These are songs very loosely inspired by his streaming queue, usually about or related to selling drugs in some way. It isn’t the strongest work from either artist, but the white EDM DJ turned rap producer and the face-tatted trap rapper from Watts make a good odd couple. Greedo leaned heavily on his melodies for Still Summer in the Projects, but from the rapid-fire mumbles of “Traffic” to the staggered chants of “Aye Twin,” his raps are center stage here. Greedo has said that making music isn’t a conscious process for him, but this time he at least had some external stimuli: he would watch scenes from his favorite movies on his phone in the studio and then hop in the booth to apply them to his raps. The tape does enough to earn its title, but some of the duo’s most impressive connections come when they aren’t trying to make good on its premise.  Greedo remains one of the best rappers working, even behind bars, and his style is all-purpose: “Payback” flips Big Tymers’ “Still Fly” into a stunter’s anthem, while he pairs off with Maxo Kream for some respect-the-shooter flaunting on “Beg Your Pardon.” Kenny Beats has a way of punching up a rapper’s sound without losing his own: adding more bite to Rico Nasty’s mosh-raps, bringing suavity to Freddie Gibbs's pusher chronicles, warping Atlanta trap for outsider Key!, pushing Vince Staples toward the bounce of SoCal radio. But Greedo told him to set all the “Greedo shit” he’d prepared to the side and give him something else. It’s clear he wanted to branch out in as many directions as possible in his limited time —as he puts it in the making-of doc, “You gotta show ‘em as hard as you would’ve been, in a short period of time.” Thus, Kenny lets Greedo rummage through his recent releases like a kid at a Redbox kiosk. Freddie, Key!, and Vince all appear, and it’s a bit like binging the last two years of Kenny Beats with Greedo offering director’s commentary. The vibe is more couch potato than cinephile, and the tape works because it doesn’t take itself too seriously. There are Home Alone bars, some character-actor bars you’d expect (Blow’s George Jung) and some you wouldn’t (Stitch from the animated Disney franchise), bars running through the Brad Pitt IMDb, and rapper-movie inception bars (in which Greedo thinks he’s Paid in Full’s Rico, a character played by Cam’ron). Songs like “Blue People” and “Honey I Shrunk the Kids” construct entire snappy hooks out of nothing more than titles. With Netflix & Chill, 03 Greedo and Kenny Beats never try to make a movie; they’re content to be distracted and charmed by them, and that preoccupation becomes contagious.",03 Greedo / Kenny Beats: Netflix & Deal Album Review | Pitchfork,7.5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a summer declared “lost” by partygoers and beach-dwellers, 03 Greedo barely felt the sun on his face. The transcendent L.A. rapper was enclosed in a cramped cell at the Middleton Unit in Abilene, TX, serving year two of a 20 year sentence for gun and drug trafficking charges. And starting on July 1, for 40 days and 40 nights, he was cut off from the outside world—no phone calls, no visits, not even fresh air—as Middleton went into total lockdown, tightening its vice grip on thousands of incarcerated people in response to the coronavirus pandemic. At the start of his sprawling new album Load It Up Vol. 01, Greedo talks through prison phone static about the meaning of its title. It’s a mindstate—“I know I had to load up on songs and albums in order to feed my family while I was gone,” he says. It’s also lingo, a command to the album’s sole producer Ron-RonTheProducer—“Me and Ron-Ron would work from, like, 9pm to 9am, nigga playing beats. Soon as I hear some hot shit, I be like ‘load it up.’” The call ends, Ron-Ron’s tag plays, and what follows is an hour of lived-in, reliable street rap from a couple years ago that continues to shape and contour the psyche of a rapper in his final days of freedom. Greedo’s greatest, bleakest accomplishment since incarceration hasn’t been any one album, but rather that he unfurled so much of himself into his brief months in the studio before he turned himself in. He was effectively forced to create at a hyper-accelerated pace, to drain himself into stuffy, exhausting nights with a rotating cast of rappers, producers, A&Rs and journalists just so he could feed his family and keep his name alive while the system put him away. In that stretch, he allegedly recorded dozens of projects. So far, we’ve gotten five: two tightly coiled albums with A-list producers Kenny Beats and DJ Mustard; two EPs with Travis Barker and Nef The Pharaoh; and now, Load It Up Vol. 01, with longtime collaborator Ron-RonTheProducer. It’s by far the most classically Greedo of the bunch, open and percolating and reminiscent in sound and form to projects like The Wolf Of Grape Street and God Level. On Load it Up, Ron-Ron and Greedo tap into a brooding, midtempo groove that navigates the purple hues between trap and L.A. street rap. There are no love songs, no experiments in pop. These are lusty, self-possessed screeds that flow with the buzzing synergy of a wired night in the studio. Greedo doesn’t directly allude to his then-impending prison sentence more than a few times on this album, but his frantic race against time is noticeable. There is a palpable urgency in the way Greedo, for instance, raps through error and mumbling, as though there’s no time for retakes. On to the next song. Still, Greedo finds fascinating ways to weave together disparate thoughts into numbing, transportive images. On “Gucci Of My City,” he compares himself to Gucci Mane—a star who, like Greedo, spent his prime years behind bars — then shrouds his whole world in the tinted glass of car windows and Gucci lenses, almost to suggest that he’d rather stay anonymous even when he’s free. And on “Scary Movie,” he draws a line through Friday The 13th and AKs, headless horsemen and hollow tips, all to paint a ghoulish picture of the projects. This is writing that isn’t writerly, full of impressionistic detail; it’s the mark of an artist constantly observing, constantly connecting. Most rewardingly, it is still such a thrill to just listen to Greedo. For how conservative the production feels, Greedo is still wholly unpredictable, one of the best with Auto-Tune this side of Future. He’ll twist the tails of phrases into oblique, ballooning shapes (“Gwap”), launch into breathless, croaky tirades (“Choppa Hold A Hunnit”), warble on high notes while they flutter through pitch-correction (“Same Zone Interlude”). His energy is whirring and kinetic and seems to rub off on the guests—Chief Keef, Sada Baby, Key Glock, and more—who all deliver top-flight verses. That feeling of witnessing the rapper deeply in his zone recalls earlier, more hopeful times. Such is the tragic, inescapable truth of Greedo’s pre-prison recording spree: how it ceaselessly transports you to alternate timelines and more forgiving worlds. Greedo has lost a chunk of life over drug and gun charges that could be traced back to a litany of systemic factors, including losing his father as a child, moving into Watts’ insular, oppressive Jordan Downs projects as an outcast teenager, facing bouts of homelessness, having a baby at 18, and losing his closest friend Lil Money in a gunfight. Load It Up, Vol 01 is undeniable; it’s also inextricably tied to these cold, cruel facts. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

5,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/03-greedo-still-summer-in-the-projects/,2019-04-24T05:00:00,['03 Greedo'],Still Summer in the Projects,"The incarcerated Watts rapper’s latest release, a collaboration with Mustard, is exultant and Dionysian. Just as 03 Greedo was getting a foothold in rap, he was sent away. Sentenced to 20 years for drug and gun possession, the already-prolific Watts rapper grew more so, amassing a cache of music to sustain his relevance during a long bid. Prison, as he saw it, is no excuse for inactivity. “Everything is strategic,” he said in a Noisey documentary. “When they look at me, they have to see an icon.” Still Summer in the Projects, the second release from this trove, comes on the heels of Greedo’s brisk tape with Nef the Pharaoh, Porter 2 Grape, and offers a bracing contrast to last summer’s heart-rending God Level. Featuring an entire slate of beats from Mustard (née DJ), Still Summer in the Projects is often exultant and Dionysian. The lyrics are full of bedroom pregames, post-club wind downs, strip-club negotiations, and trap-house sex. It is not uncommon for a coke deal to fund an all-nighter on ecstasy. Mustard and 03 Greedo make the most of each other’s talents; Greedo’s crooning and rapping melt into the plush spaces of Mustard’s sweltering cookout beats. “Grapevine” and “Bet I Walk” have liberating, improvisational flows, but Greedo is taut and controlled on “10 Purple Summers,” reeling off lines like, “I ain’t worried about no frivolous movement,” as if he’s invincible. Greedo has an almost supernatural way with potent, bluesy melodies. Both gruff and graceful, his singsong raps straddle the line between Chief Keef’s growls and the honeyed coos of Ty Dolla $ign. In a suite of songs across the middle of the album (“Loaded,” “Getting Ready,” “In the Morning”), he sings as sweetly as ever. He performs with a joy that almost makes you forget that he’s a ward of the Texas prison system. And that’s kind of the point. For most of the project, Greedo dances around his prison sentence, recalling something he discussed in the Noisey documentary: No one going to prison wants to spend their last precious moments free talking about going to prison, much less rapping about it. But on the closer, “Visions,” the crushing reality finally sets in. “Locked inside a cell with no windows/Hope I make it out of this prison/I’ll be coming out with a vengeance” he croons tenderly, promising us that “once I get out, I’ll be richer.” The song closes with a heartbreaking voicemail from prison: “I’ll be back sooner than May,” he says. Even inside a Texas cell, 03 Greedo is an optimist, transmitting visions of a brighter tomorrow.",03 Greedo: Still Summer in the Projects Album Review | Pitchfork,7.6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/03-greedo-the-wolf-of-grape-street/,2018-03-15T05:00:00,['03 Greedo'],The Wolf of Grape Street,"The latest collection from the Watts rapper is an essential piece of West Coast rap, at times pulsating and manic, born from a singular writer and chameleonic stylist. 03 Greedo has an artificially constructed eardrum, metal fused into his left leg, and clusters of grapes tattooed onto his skin. He spent his childhood in Sacramento, rural Kansas, Compton, and St. Louis, where he lived “in the basement in a house made of bricks.” At times he was, effectively, homeless. Around the turn of the century, he moved into Jordan Downs, a housing project off of Grape Street in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts. Barely a teenager, he fell in with the Grape Street Crips. His rap name is a paper-thin veil for those gang ties—he dropped a digit from 103, for 103rd St., and tweaked “Greedy”—and, in interviews, effectively shrugs at the obviousness. He has a popular mixtape trilogy called Purple Summer, he reasons, and there are those stenciled grapes. “How are they not gonna know?” As a rapper, Greedo’s momentum in L.A. has been interrupted by jail stints and creative ebbs, but was accelerated in the last 20 months with a deluge of new music: nearly seven hours across the three Purple Summer tapes and Money Changes Everything, each of which is gripping and shockingly consistent. Because he moves so fluidly between styles, it’s difficult to point to a single Greedo song as a distillation of his sound or vision, but the best point of entry might be “Mafia Business,” the tribute to a friend who was murdered in the summer of 2016 that’s become his biggest hit. It sounds like a song you’ve heard before that’s being played in the distance, maybe underwater. Greedo bends his voice into something resembling a prayer for the dead to be allowed free passage; he raps, “I swear I haven’t cried in a hundred years/Last night a nigga cried about a hundred tears.” In the video, dozens of people, most draped in purple, hug, mourn, smile, dance, sometimes holding a two-dimensional cardboard cutout of the deceased with a real purple bandana tied around its neck. It is, to an extent, Greedo’s on-record identity in microcosm: familiar elements rearranged in ways that seem just a little bit foreign. The lengths of those four breakthrough tapes we intimidating, but they served a welcome creative purpose for Greedo. When a project runs 30 or 40 songs, there’s less pressure on any individual track to carry the narrative or stylistic weight of the record writ large, and so songs are allowed to breathe as one-offs or asides or experiments. Greedo’s free to snap and cheese at the camera and dedicate full cuts to his love of Lil Boosie’s music. On The Wolf of Grape Street, Greedo folds songs from his past work in with new records, too. But unlike Lil Boosie’s Bad Azz (Greedo cites it as his “Bible”), which roped in hits from his run as a cult mixtape star and was more or less a comprehensive survey of his styles, The Wolf of Grape Street is a careful act of editing, uniform in its urgency, with songs carefully chosen from Greedo’s massive vault and arranged to sound frantic and claustrophobic. It’s a pulsating, manic record from a singular writer and chameleonic stylist. One of the things that makes Greedo’s music so compelling is the way he collapses the distance between one idea and the next. The ghosts that hang over his music—death, prison—are never too far away, and they color even the songs where they don’t swoop in. On Wolf, this means that a sex song on which Greedo worries his partner might set up him (“Beat That Thang Down”) dissolves into another (“Run For Yo Life) where he’s sleeping with a jailed man’s girlfriend into “Look At Me Now,” which he delivers mostly in a shout, and which starts with him flexing his record deal with the mogul Todd Moscowitz and ends with him repeating “same age that my daddy died.” It has the effect of placing his career as a performer on the same plane as the often unbelievable pain he expresses in his music: there’s no comfortable divide between what he sees in the boardroom and what he sees behind his eyelids. The Wolf of Grape Street takes its name, obviously, from The Wolf of Wall Street, but where Scorsese imagined coiffed securities agents as the swirling vultures, Greedo was targeted by bounty hunters who shackled him in a van for nearly a week while they extradited him to the Texas panhandle. He’s facing 25-to-99 years on drug charges and 2-to-20 on gun charges. Jail has always figured prominently in Greedo’s writing, but the stakes here feel, understandably, far graver. That real-world legal peril is inextricable from the tortured “Paranoid Pt. 03” (“I think I need another lawyer”), and from the breathless pace of the album as a whole. None of which to say Greedo’s music, or Wolf in particular, is humorless or oppressively heavy. “If I Wasn’t Rappin’” is bright and propulsive; he dives headlong into gleeful wordplay like, “Love my sisters on some black shit/White girl in my fucking baggage.” Even those men who descended on him from Texas are made to sound like a minor inconvenience: “Fuck the bounty, I’m just laughing.” The self-produced “Neva Bend,” another of his mixtape hits, broaches immense sorrow but is a little alien, drenched in synths and packed with melody and resolve: In the video, he raps, “My mama made me a star” while dragging a pistol across his face. As a vocalist, Greedo sometimes channels contemporaries from Atlanta like Young Thug, breaking form in his verses to launch into song or hopping off the drums to rap more animatedly. But he’s also comfortable using more linear means to wring the emotion from his records. He’ll slip from pained yelps into crystal-clear diction, from venomous songs about kids getting jacked for their sneakers to sprawling lullabies about drug addiction, punctuated by the sound of seagulls. All of this makes him difficult to pin down in a rote lineage of Los Angeles rappers, but as Greedo will abruptly correct interviewers, he’s not from L.A.—he’s from Watts. The Wolf of Grape Street draws its power from that sort of specificity, but coheres into a broader rebuke of dread, panic, and walls closing in, wherever they might be.",03 Greedo: The Wolf of Grape Street Album Review | Pitchfork,8.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The 22-year-old singer’s chest-thumping appearance on “Ghost Town” was a glimmer of promise amid a heap of sloppy, single-take recordings, one of the few times on the album actually seemed transcendent. Her debut, Modus Vivendi, proves our ears weren’t deceiving us. The album is intensely sincere, with the New Jersey native proudly serving her soul raw atop bullish, beautiful production. It is the most compelling and complete release under G.O.O.D. Music since Pusha T’s Daytona. The heavy-hearted vibes begin immediately on the opener, “Don’t Break The Silence.” Shake’s ambered voice rises over a floating synth and describes a lover who isn’t quite ready to break things off. “If you were liquid, you’d be bitter like wine/Till then I’ma drink, stay here for the ride,” she hums out. The feelings of desire, being desired, and all the messiness in between are at the center of Modus Vivendi, a Latin term used to describe an arrangement between two conflicting parties in the hopes of coexisting peacefully. For Shake, that harmony is elusive, not only in her relationships with women but also in her own heart. On “Terminal B,” she grapples with whether the warm feelings of a relationship can be trusted, poking at it like it’s too good to be true. “Yeah baby, she’s on lockdown love,” she murmurs before immediately second-guessing herself: “Maybe she is not down.” All this heaviness is packaged neatly within bright melodies built for lovesick kids to belt out at Coachella and Rolling Loud. This gives her songs a tone of triumph and catharsis rather than total defeat, like on the hook for “Morrow,” where she dejectedly lets a partner know, “I don’t know if I’ll be here tomorrow,” but stretches out the last word in snappy fragments, similar to Rihanna’s ad-libs on “Umbrella.” She goes for a higher register on “Come Around,” where she cries out for someone to join her in her loneliness, like she’s trapped at the bottom of a well, yelling at a sliver of sky. The elasticity of her voice isn’t always utilized properly here, perhaps the result of too much experimentation in the studio. On a few tracks, she ventures too far into trap-rap territory, dumbing her voice down to a mumbled delivery, like on “Rocketship,” which could serve as a Travis Scott reference track in how similar it is to his auto-tuned sound. She dips heavily into voice modulation on the album as a whole, recently telling Pitchfork that this was done to make her sound “more real.” In actuality, it achieves the opposite effect, creating a degree of separation between her in and the listener by placing a governor on the amount of emotion she conveys. At times, you find yourself yearning for her voice to be left more naked and vulnerable. These are largely the only missteps on an otherwise richly produced album. Modus is essentially the antithesis of the half-baked works that arose from Kanye’s Wyoming sessions in 2018. It is the result of a handful of talented collaborators who provide enough eclecticism to balance out the bombastic sound of G.O.O.D. in-house producer Mike Dean. For every “Come Around” built on the same roaring synths Dean supplied for Yeezus, there’s an infectious ’80s-inspired jam like “Guilty Conscience.” “The Pines,” meanwhile, is constructed on a distorted chant similar to the one played out on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy switch-up “Hell Of A Life,” but finishes with a thunderous string arrangement, giving Dean’s sound some refreshing variance. The most inspired works, though, come from former Stills member Dave Hamelin, who gives Shake ethereal, dreamy soundscapes to navigate through, none more pretty than the closer “Flight319.” Over astral chords that conjure images of misty daybreak, Shake encapsulates her internal tug of war by alternating between lines of confidence and shame, optimism and fear. Eventually, the drums cut out and she hits a point of reflection: “Oh, I’ll never know, how long I’ll stay, how far I’ll go.” Everything is in agreement, even if it’s just for a moment.",070 Shake: Modus Vivendi Album Review | Pitchfork,7.3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What is wrong with people? Aberfeldy recorded their debut, Young Forever, using a single microphone. Good for them. In that spirit, I'll cut short my obligatory introduction and bring you straight to the Edinburgh group's lovelorn, unfortunately still-beating heart, exposed by the oh-so-unadorned production: ""Love is a verb and a noun as well
You find it in the dictionary under 'L'"" That little witticism comes from ""Love Is an Arrow"", written and sung by Riley Briggs. Based on one photo, Briggs looks like a young Anthony Michael Hall, though his vocals chart a fairly standard indie course, borrowing from Neil Young (""A Friend Like You""), Ben Gibbard (""What You Do"") and plain-spoken sensitive guys everywhere. Listen, some of my best friends are plain-spoken sensitive guys. Some of my favorite albums consist of campfire singalongs by bands with modest acoustic guitar chops, cute names and still-cuter accents. But those lyrics! No band that would sing such words deserves the easily made comparisons to fellow Scots Belle & Sebastian or even Camera Obscura, let alone those earnest Aussies, The Lucksmiths. (Compare them to twee progenitors like The Pastels or Talulah Gosh and you owe me your cardigan.) Of course, with a moniker nipped from a Scottish vacation destination, Aberfeldy practically beg for such name-dropping. But there's no need to encourage them. Throughout the record, Briggs shows a predisposition toward bungling the old English teachers' motto: show, not tell. This may be the result of a medical condition, like dyslexia, in which case we should hold our snark. Still, it seems like this guy can't open his mouth without saying nothing. ""So sad you're leaving,"" he sings on ""Out of Love""; ""I'm so lonely now she's gone,"" he adds on ""Tie One On"", which teems with such vivid storytelling. He goes on to rhyme ""sacred"" with ""wasted"" and ""reasons"" with ""leaving"" until somewhere the editor of a rhyming dictionary loses her job. As is so often the case, Aberfeldy are at their best when they stumble beyond trite infantilism. First single ""Vegetarian Restaurant"" lopes along with winning ""Tangled Up in Blue"" guitar strums, accented with subtle fiddles and lovely boy/girl harmonies. What Briggs is seemingly aiming at on the album is a cheerful, unpretentious look at the everyday; here, he finally makes the everyday interesting. ""I like the way that you dance when you're in the kitchen,"" he says, and I'm willing to see where the dance takes him. Then he proclaims, ""Sometimes I can't believe you're even human,"" and I duck for cover. Speaking of aliens, ""Heliopolis by Night"" is the record's next-strongest track (and incidentally, its second single), a whimsical spaceship song complete with nose-held vocals. It's not perfect, but it's unique. So yeah, Young Forever was recorded on one microphone. And yeah, that means the warm acoustic pop heats up my headphones like a veritable heliopolis. I can't help but root for an album that begins ""I love everyone,"" because the last thing the indie world needs is another batch of sullen, well-dressed scenesters. Yet, as in any relationship, just because you love someone doesn't mean they'll love you back. ""There is nothing in the world as beautiful as you,"" Gibbs tells us in a tender moment. He probably means it. Good for him. Even if he doesn't, I hope it gets him laid.",Aberfeldy: Young Forever Album Review | Pitchfork,3.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

ABCS are all about unity. Their bandname comes from the first letters of their last names, and their album cover shows three slightly slouching skeletons all decked out in a green glow. Their album is a proclamation about just how tight a band can get. By wielding sax (Gabe Andruzzi), drums (Josh Blair), and accordion (Pete Cafarella), ABCS deftly flaunt their skills by dealing in abrupt time changes, start and stop progressions, and a heavy mixture of solo, duet and trio work while remaining almost entirely outside of any obvious rock context. The unity demonstrated throughout the six songs on ABCS relies on the band's incorporation of strange instrumentation. An accordion is yanked out of its usual Germanic setting and thrust into a punk rock Terry Riley/Phil Glass jam that references polka, ska, and Pauline Oliveros. The sax, which sticks more strictly to its typical jazz context and occasionally adds breathy, ambient elements, is constantly yelling across the room at the other instruments, ignoring their rabid retorts. This album is the ABCS' debut release, and it shines with all the enthusiasm of anything new. It starts on an up note, kicking through the door and screaming, and doesn't stop pushing until the whole fucking mess grinds to a halt. It's mesmerizing and, oddly, very fresh sounding: though obviously informed by a variety of styles and philosophies, ABCS manage to avoid getting stuck on any of them. And there's where ABCs really transcend their contemporaries: transition. The best improvisers are those who can shuffle in and out of various modes while remaining on all the time. These guys benefit from the same skills by keeping things dynamic, yet recognizable. And because they'll continue to play with each other in a way that is truly with each other, liberally using alchemy and accordion to accomplish their tasks, the album stands as a true testament to 1 + 1 + 1 = 1.",Various Artists: ABCS Album Review | Pitchfork,8.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When it scouts for worms, it rocks its body and stomps its feet in a funky little dance-walk; ditto when wooing potential mates. In April, Laura Les and Dylan Brady of the avant-garde pop duo 100 gecs posted a TikTok of three woodcocks—one adult, two babies—doing this strut, soundtracked to an array of beeps, honks, xylophone hits, and squeaks. (They made the audio.) Depending on your imagination, the final product looks like a bird family humping invisible Bop Its or competing in an intense round of Dance Dance Revolution. All of it is quintessentially gecs—the “beep boop” cacophony; the playful iteration on a meme; the subtle sweetness. Most of all: It’s weird. It’s fun. Don’t think too hard about it. According to one oft-told account, the name “100 gecs” originates from an accident in which an online lizard retailer shipped Les too many live geckos, leaving her with 100 instead of one; in the vast constellation of memes, “100 gecs” feels like an intellectual predecessor to “30-50 feral hogs.” On their 2019 studio debut, 1000 gecs, the duo’s arch, impish humor popped up in aggro copypasta-style taunts (“Hey, you little piss baby/You think you’re so fucking cool?”) and tragicomic tales of betting on a “stupid horse.” They specialize in hyperactive collisions of “uncool” genres: ska, dubstep, and ’00s metalcore, not to mention the sort of witless EDM that convinced you “I’m a vegetarian and I ain’t fucking scared of him” was the sickest diss ever. Writers often compare listening to their music to the whiplash of thumbing through digital feeds, but 100 gecs resist the cultivated eccentricity common on Twitter or TikTok, eliciting instead the spontaneous freedom of riffing in a group chat. Listening to 100 gecs is like watching your buds test out tricks at the skatepark: it’s less about precision and polish than the act of being together and having a good time. For their remix album, 1000 gecs and the Tree of Clues, Les and Brady have assembled a rowdy crew of friends, including expected PC Music affiliates like Charli XCX and A.G. Cook and new faces like Fall Out Boy, Rico Nasty, and alt-rap group Injury Reserve. 100 gecs’ music already sounds reconfigured; a remix album just pushes their techniques of extraction, warping, and recombining further, lending Tree of Clues the novelty and depth of an original. While the original “xXXi_wud_nvrstøp_ÜXXx” already interpolates Soulja Boy’s long-distance classic “Kiss Me Thru the Phone”—released a year after the invention of the first iPhone—the Eurodance-inspired remix digs deeper into the exultant rush of the late ’00s. Estonian rapper Tommy Cash hams it up with a Soviet Pitbull impression: “Mr. Worldwide … International killa!” Meanwhile, Hannah Diamond and Dylan Brady pine over untouchable lovers. Its chorus of entering and disappearing voices evokes DJ Earworm’s 2009 “United States of Pop” mashup; both reassemble the shiny debris of the ’00s into new shapes, eulogizing bygone optimism. “Let’s go all the way,” Brady trills, the same giddy, romantic dare from Katy Perry’s “Teenage Dream” a decade ago. The guests skillfully mold the originals into creations of their own, while still preserving some of the songs’ initial ideas. Dylan Brady was already channeling Fall Out Boy on the original “hand crushed by a mallet,” so hearing Patrick Stump bellow on the remix alongside Craig Owens of post-hardcore band Chiodos and Canadian singer-songwriter Nicole Dollanganger makes the original feel like a demo. Noise-pop duo Black Dresses’ thrashing interpretation of “745 sticky” magnifies the chaos and hedonism documented on the track. Unfortunately, Injury Reserve’s attempt with the same song is less successful. Their version of “745 sticky” is buried under extraneous car honks and clown squeaks, but the growling, voracious “GODDAMN” in the second chorus almost rescues it. Peculiarities like these keep things lively. “Please hold while I connect you to a rock hard wet gec,” Dylan Brady purrs in a sweaty phone sex monologue on the Dorian Electra-assisted “gec 2 Ü.” GFOTY and Count Baldour’s “stupid horse” remix kicks off with an actual whinney. Perhaps the biggest transformation occurs on “gecgecggec.” The original is a whimsical assembly of crime-scene music, game-show-style sound effects, and more, with incessant “gec gec gec gec”-s that sound croaked by brainless seagulls. The remix is a gummy pop-rap song. Those “gec” sounds are looped into a beat over which Lil West raps about bitches, racks, and convertibles. “If she wanna fuck, she call me,” he brags, adopting a DaBaby flow. But this cold, cocky front slowly crumbles, as Atlanta rapper-singer Tony Velour ends his melodic verse on the concession, “You got my strongest love.” By the time Laura Les appears, the mood is of complete and utter vulnerability: “Baby, I’m not stronger than you,” she wails. Online, skeptics wonder if fans only like 100 gecs as a meme; and yet, their sincerity hides in plain sight. The sad “gec 2 Ü” becomes sadder when Danny L Harle emulates Owl City’s burbling, saccharine production. Its wide-eyed innocence only underscores the tragedy of the premise: two people failing to meet each other’s needs, thunderous bass pounding like chunks of hail to emphasize the force of their agony. In a recent interview, Les confronted a sore spot in the coverage of 100 gecs. “We’re having fun,” she clarified, “we’re not fucking being ironic.” The duo began seriously working together after being invited to perform at Minecraft festivals, where artists attempt things “too stupid or too funny” for Spotify release, like cramming 30-40 songs into a 20-minute set. 100 gecs’ music feels tailor-made for a world like Minecraft, full of childlike pixelated figures wandering free in a vast, lonely landscape. On “came to my show,” one of two original songs on the album, a high-pitched voice whimpers, “I can’t believe you came to my show/It hurts when you don’t.” It’s a pure, wrenching distillation of the simple desire for someone to be there for you. While swerving through memes, genre pile-ups, and decades, 100 gecs crash into one idea over and over: There are always missed connections.

If you're the type to take pleasure in connecting dots across the overwhelmingly scattered trends of 2010s digital music culture, then 100 gecs are right up your alley. Production and songwriting duo Dylan Brady and Laura Les—hailing from Los Angeles and Chicago, respectively—make abrasive, maximalist pop music that isn’t so much indefinable as it is endlessly identifiable, cross-sectioning myriad mainstream-leaning and definitively underground music released over the last decade. Nothing they’re doing is new, per se, but the way in which they do it feels fresh and appealingly unique. PC Music’s arch, conceptualist cyber-pop is an easy reference point, as are the crunchy, compressed headbangers that Sleigh Bells pumped out in their prime; at times, 100 gecs sound like Visible Cloaks producing for Charli XCX (fittingly, Brady’s already turned in an official remix for the latter’s Lizzo-assisted single “Blame It on Your Love”). The duo’s most defiantly ear-bleeding moments recall the bass-shaking abrasions of XXXTentacion’s “Look at Me!”—but they also bring a sense of cocked-eyebrow playfulness shared with storied Swedish indie label Sincerely Yours, especially the dearly missed Situationist pop act the Tough Alliance. If that sounds like a lot, wait until you get a load of 1000 gecs, one of the year's most fascinating, exhilarating experimental pop albums. There’s no better title for this thing than 1000 gecs, which references both the group’s charming self-titled 2017 debut and their sheer multiple-atop-multiple audaciousness. The album’s singles to date—the pulsing, cavity-inducing “Money Machine” and “800db Cloud”’s drop-dotted miserabilia—both conclude in washes of coruscating noise and death-metal thrashing; “I Need Help Immediately” is a sounds-of-the-studio collage in which the most recognizable melodic line sounds like an inverted McDonald’s jingle. The style and attitude of hip-hop is pervasive, but that barely encapsulates 100 gecs’ wild-eyed genre mishmash, which covers chiptuned pop-punk, chintzy trance synths, and the closely mic’d intimacy of indie pop—sometimes all in the same song. Brady and Les are musical fabulists, but 1000 gecs surprisingly rewards close listening when it comes to lyrical content, too. Though the opening line of “Money Machine”—“Hey, you lil’ piss baby”—scans as pure chest-puffing braggadocio, it also contains one of the most appealingly strange taunts in recent memory: “You talk a lotta big game/For someone with such a small truck.” “Stupid Horse” is the catchiest song about the dangers of racetrack betting since the Hold Steady’s “Chips Ahoy!,” doubling as a hilarious evocation of financial hedonism and a touching tale of animal liberation. “Ringtone,” 1000 gecs’ clearest-eyed selection, details intimacy in the age of group chats before its sweet sentiment curdles like milk left out on the counter: “Used to love that ringtone when you called me/Now it makes me sick.” 1000 gecs saw release in May on Brady’s Dog Show label, and the duo is currently affiliated with Diplo’s always-trending Mad Decent imprint as well. But they’re not for everyone, and that might be an understatement. Brady and Les’ ability to turn on various sonic and thematic dimes—to describe a loving exchange between two long-distance paramours one minute and brag about being addicted to Monster energy drinks the next—can be disorienting. Even at their most accessible, 100 gecs sound like a bunch of fireworks stuffed into a fax machine, or human beings singing in the key of dial-up. They traffic in pure and uncut absurdity, but even their most outrageous moments radiate a strange sincerity—the kind that could only come from two denizens of a perpetually logged-on generation.",100 gecs: 1000 gecs Album Review | Pitchfork,7.4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Any other Wednesday morning would have opened with a shock into consciousness at precisely 6:30 a.m. I tend to respond by rolling slightly to the right, just enough to smite the snooze button and earn myself another nine minutes. But on this particular morning, I gave myself a few extra hours to recover from the previous night's three-hour haul from Washington, D.C. I'd been in D.C. for a concert by Pitchfork heartthrobs Sigur Rós. The Album Leaf (aka Tristeza's Jimmy LaValle) opened the show accompanied by another guitarist and synth player, a bassist, and a drummer. I suppose the band was effective in setting the mood with their unsurprising washes of Fender Rhodes, delayed guitar lines, and well, pretty much delayed everything. And while their performance was fairly forgettable, their simplicity mellowed the crowd in the only way appropriate before we were to be enveloped in the gorgeousness of our glacial Icelanders. So yeah, I woke up around 10:30 (the wallpaper contractor I'd set an appointment with a few days earlier finally roused my sleepy ass out of bed by banging 100,000 times on the front door). Cardboard boxes were strewn across the floor of my room, all of which had arrived while I was out the day before, most bearing the ""Insound"" return address. These were empty, of course, and a stack of unwrapped discs sat patiently on my desk. I glanced at the new music with a bit of indecisiveness, then pulled out the Album Leaf's One Day I'll Be on Time from somewhere near the bottom of the pile. I wasn't excepting anything spectacular from the record, and as it turned out, there were no surprises. ""Gust of..."" gently opens with-- shock!-- a droning organ before proceeding into pretty homogenous figures of arpeggiating organ and synthlines. Homogenous, that is, to the entire record. Every few songs we get a bit of guitar, and if we're lucky, drums or drum-machine. But for the most part, One Day I'll Be on Time is about minimalism: minimal song variation, minimal melodic creativity, minimal staying power. There are, of course, a few instrumental pop numbers for contrast. ""In Between Lines,"" a prime example, wouldn't have sounded out of place on U2's last record. (This is not a compliment.) Interlocking lines of delayed guitar hit it off with lighthearted beat programming and facile synth ornaments. Perhaps the banality of the track could have been maximized had Bono been called in to sing over it. The record isn't an utter waste, though; a couple moments of serenity are sequenced well enough to save it from total abandonment. The best of these comes with ""Story Board."" The track seems to have been recorded with a single compressor microphone in a room with the windows open, letting the sounds of highway traffic seep in. We imagine LaValle hunched over his acoustic guitar in an asinine mockery of Nick Drake's disconsolate poses. Here, the subtle Rhodes overdubs, rather than seeming contrived, complement the circular patterns of guitar quite calmly. But the bulk of One Day I'll Be on Time's remaining duration, despite the genre in which this record could easily be pigeonholed, is far from easy listening. ""Vermillion"" all too dangerously approaches new age cheese; ""Hang Over"" is like an inebriated guitarist stumbling over his own minimalism; and ""Glimmer,"" the album's closer, is... wait, I already used ""new age,"" right? By the time the record ended, I'd forgotten about the wallpaper guy, who had already nearly finished putting up the new pattern downstairs. As I descended, he asked me what it was I'd been listening to. ""The Album Leaf."" He mentioned that he was also a massage therapist (I'm thinking he's like that guy on ""The Pretender"" who can do anything), and that he thought the album would be ""very appropriate"" for his massage sessions. Considering the nature of the album, that possibility didn't seem too remote. Somehow, the conversation got around to ambient music and Brian Eno (What can I say? This guy is The Pretender!). I contended that Brian Eno is a virtuoso of space, which contributes to the dynamism of his ambient works, and that James LaValle simply changes instruments to create what ends up being an artificial dynamic. The contractor agreed, but then reminded me that even Brian Eno has produced a few U2 records.",The Album Leaf: One Day I'll Be on Time Album Review | Pitchfork,5.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
13,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1000-dents-and-shells/,2004-10-07T06:00:03,['Richard Buckner'],Dents and Shells,"Singer/songwriter Richard Buckner's latest excursion into impressionistic gradations of tone and mood gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ""math-rock."" If it wasn't already apparent, Richard Buckner's sixth album, Dents and Shells, drives the point home: The man is nearly immutable. With the exception of his forays into folk-rock (Since and Impasse), Buckner's evolution has been judicious and purposeful. His debut, the 1994 classic Bloomed, was a palimpsest of ornate gray graphite sketches, and on subsequent albums he's put his collar up against the wind and trudged deeper into the chilly, murky recesses of his aesthetic. Since that first album, Buckner has created increasingly more ephemeral, impressionistic gradations of tone and mood. Dents and Shells continues to explore Buckner's shadowy continent of song, a Symbolist mirror-world where bright glints of detail fleetingly flash, then submerge, cloaked in shifting fogs. Dents and Shells is Buckner in top form, using a broad brush to manifest his enigmatic poetics, hallucinatory atmospheres, and melodies that appear and evaporate like breath exhaled onto cold glass. The vanishing drone and epic percussive sweep (provided by ex-Butthole Surfer King Coffey) of ""Charmers"", and the hushed, ramshackle clatter of ""As the Waves Will Always Roll"" ably demonstrate this singer-as-condensation sensibility. While strongly rooted in classic folk, Buckner's songs are rendered pristinely strange by their smallness and smeariness-- they're vast, dim topographies described by chords that are barely there, recondite realms of visions and visitations. Buckner is the disembodied Eye roving freely within impossible spaces, cataloging impressionistic signatures through a hazy lens. But it's not all simmer and seethe: Buckner's more ponderous tunes are leavened with lovely pop ballads like ""Her"", a sturdy platform of guitar decorated with a twinkling, frugal piano from which he calls out ""to nothing, in the wake of watching her sipping wine from a camping cup on some missing night."" Superficially, Dents and Shells trods the well-worn folk paths of heartache and loss, but its lingering impression is more aligned with the elegant and darkly compelling logic of math. Most shapes found in nature have mathematical counterparts, and the shifting, complex patterns of Buckner's lyrics and guitar work peel back the surfaces to reveal the numbers underpinning everything. In this sub-world, the sky is a grid, the stars are vertices, the horizon of a distant shore is an x-axis, and the shells dotting it are the spiraling integers of the Fibonacci Sequence. On ""A Chance Counsel""-- a classically Buckner confection of gleaming chords and drawled warbling-- he sings: ""Let's hear the outline,"" and later, ""listen at a number on the door."" To hear the outlines, the fraught spaces between tangible objects or discernible thoughts, is what Buckner teaches us to do. By listening at the numbers, he upturns the precise shells of logic and reveals dents in the sand that contain the mysteries skirting the outlines of natural law. By now, Buckner is so far inside his vision that one fails to really see him-- the man sinks beneath all the swirling phantoms, the inscrutable blocks of coded image, and the eddying currents of blurry atmosphere he's summoned up around him. By the same token, one wonders if he can see out anymore. His increasingly esoteric songs suggest that the musical cocoon he's been spinning around himself for a decade deflects his sight inward again and again. Regardless, it's this very sense of hermetic isolation-- and of a person's consciousness not creating music, but actually becoming it-- that makes each Buckner album feel like a fresh adventure in a recurring dream: No matter how well you know the landscape, its topography remains amorphous and impossible to chart.",Richard Buckner: Dents and Shells Album Review | Pitchfork,8.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Good news: Pole's new album doesn't really sound anything like his last, 2003's self-titled effort for Mute. Even better news: It sounds even less like his early work. In one fell swoop, Pole-- Berlin studio mastermind and ~scape label proprietor Stefan Betke-- has slipped the yoke of early classics and mid-career questing alike, resulting in an album that brims with ideas and vitality but is utterly unique. A quick recap. Pole-- Betke's fourth album, and his sole longplayer for Mute, after a long run with Germany's Kiff, which licensed his material to Matador in the U.S.-- marked a concerted effort by Stefan Betke to escape the omnipresent signature of 1, 2, and 3, the classic trilogy in which he proposed and perfected an idea of gurgling, crackling dub reductionism built of little more than sigh and suggestion. Flirting with hip-hop and a newly aerated sound, Pole succeeding in escaping what Mark Richardson, writing in Pitchfork, described as the ""cul de sac"" of the artist's calcifying style, but only at the expense of the kind of coherence and cohesion that had marked his efforts until that point. He had to try something, of course. The first three records were brilliant, dredging the sedimented floor of third-hand ideas of dub passed from sources like Seefeel's ""isolationist"" ambient music and Chain Reaction's shimmering ""heroin house""-- and running the sludge through a rickety pipeline of busted filters and loose wires. But no matter how much mica (and who knows, gold) flecked his gloriously gunky stuff, there were only so many ways he could take it: even the most astonishing builders of sand castles are, ultimately, constrained by their materials. Steingarten is still based upon dub reggae, from its loping rhythms to its revolving-door chord changes to traditional reggae staples like melodica and waxy analog delay. There's still plenty of fizz in the margins, too, though it no longer defines the shape of the songs. You can kinda sorta hear a glimmer of hip-hop in the opening cut, though thankfully there's no vocalist this time out, and two of the tracks here-- the back-to-back ""Düsseldorf"" and ""Jungs""-- absorb the ubiquitous tick-tocking of Berlin minimal techno. But despite a continuity of influence, the sound of Pole's production-- its very heft-- is completely and refreshingly new. This time out, Pole has reconfigured his relationship with gravity. Where before the music felt held together (and sometimes held down) by the weight of history-- both the music's and the musician's-- and the massing sound itself, here the individual parts hang together easily, as if brought together by chance and left bobbing in each other's orbits. The music is full of empty space, though it's not the insistent absence of minimalism-- more like the languid silence between two lovers who know when speech is moot. You can hear it in the opening track, ""Warum"", where every instrument-- from the aerosol shaker to the handclaps that crack like coals burning low-- stakes out its space in the mix, ceding the middle ground to... well, to nothing at all, really. There's just a wide swathe of ground, inviting you to stand there, stretch out and touch the sounds around you. It's certainly one of the most welcoming approaches to mixing and mastering I've heard. The other big update this time out is the addition of noise-- not the blasted scree of Merzbow but an agreeable skronk sourced from muted guitar feedback and weeping tremolo. From the tube-amp uprising caught on ""Winkelstreben"" to the way he hammers at the guitar strings pulled taut below the bridge, it sounds like Betke was listening to Sonic Youth's Evol while recording Steingarten. It would be appropriate if it were true, given that this album represents the most important evolution in Pole's career. More than anything, Steingarten is a remarkably easy-going album. Like all great recordings, it opens up over time, yielding fresh discoveries with repeat listens, but it hardly guards its secrets. You can hear the simplest kind of joy in the way (in ""Düsseldorf"") a high-pitched, pinging note run through delay begins gradually to throb out of time with the rhythm track. The opposing shapes and textures in ""Winkelstreben"" create totally unexpected convergences-- improbable harmonies on a par with those found in the best abstract painting or Japanese fashion. Full of resonant, glistening, almost tangible sounds, Steingarten is a synaesthetic's dream; I find myself continually running up against the limits of my own descriptive powers in trying to tackle its pear-shaped bass drops, its corrugated ambient underpinnings, its frog-throated choruses. By contemporary standards, this is a short album: nine songs, 45 minutes. It takes guts to hold oneself to such meager numbers after a four-year hiatus, but Betke got it absolutely right: there's not a note out of place on this thing, not a single thread of delay that overstays its welcome. Steingarten is a nearly perfect album. Putting the melancholic ""Pferd"" last is just another of the record's successes; it makes the whole thing feel like a kind of meditation on the very nature of limits and limitations. Given the history of his Pole project, that's likely something Betke has mulled over plenty. Here, with inscrutable agility-- like the mechanics of meditating upon a Zen koan-- he moots the whole issue and achieves something very much like a state of grace.",Pole: Steingarten Album Review | Pitchfork,8.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
15,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10001-touch-up/,2007-03-21T05:00:03,['Mother Mother'],Touch Up,"Vancouver-based indie rock band offers acute, snappy pop songs with no discernible signs of the elbow grease it took to craft them. Effortlessness has long been one of the most endearing aspects of indie rock. While many major label giants produce albums forged over several back-breaking months, a lot of indie's greatest opuses, from Slanted and Enchanted to The Moon and Antarctica, sound like the one-off recordings of a band that just happened to stumble into a studio. Mother Mother's debut is by no means such a watershed effort, but Touch Up comes packed with acute, snappy pop songs with no discernible signs of the elbow grease it took to craft them. However, the Vancouver five-piece lives and dies by their lax nature, which, while intriguing initially, lacks consistency over an entire album. The band's quirky songwriting, combined with its affinity for acoustic-only arrangements, sounds like a throwback to goofy staples such as the Violent Femmes or the Meat Puppets. The vocal carousel of Debra-Jean Creelman and Ryan and Jean Guldemond keeps the punk-folk nuanced enough to avoid mere imitation, bending their acoustic pop from the Breeders to Devendra Banhart. Opener ""Dirty Town"" showcases the vocal triumvirate's singing and charisma at full force as they take turns fantasizing about buying a farm. The bumpkin lyrics and delivery work surprisingly well, thanks mostly to the band's mercilessly schizo shifts from one song section to the next. At its best, the band doesn't even need to rely on novelty. ""Oh Ana"" is pretty straightforward acoustic pop, rallying around jittery supernatural lyrics and a lush sound crafted by Tegan and Sara producer Howard Redekopp. The plodding title track, with its lugubrious intro guitar riff and stop-start verse, shows that the band's capable of more than just ironic hick ditties. Even the standout song's lyrics wise up, with all three singers commenting on unhealthy body image (""I need a touch up!"") over the album's most dramatic builds. On the flip side, when Mother Mother overstep their eccentric bounds and get downright kitschy, the results are pretty disastrous. The acoustic arpeggios of ""Verbatim"" sound like a loose cover of-- get ready-- TLC's ""No Scrubs"", and Ryan Guldemond's crooning about wearing women's underwear smacks of dorky-white-guy-imitating-black-guy comedy. ""Love and Truth"", while not as egregious, veers uncomfortably close to tackier female artists like Jewel or Sarah McLachlan, relying more on whimsy than artistry. These missteps aside though, the free-spirited Touch Up feels refreshing as an album isolated from a lot of today's worn-out trends and aesthetic mimicry. That two of the album's strongest songs (""Touch Up"" and ""Polynesia"") are relatively earnest is probably coincidental, though Mother Mother's laid-back vibe could use some prodding here or there, at least until their songwriting matures.",Mother Mother: Touch Up Album Review | Pitchfork,6.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Berlin-based songwriter Sabrina Milena sounds natural lodged deep inside a grim dirge. ""Thirsty"", the third song on her full-length debut, is the record's quintessential track, the guitar and banjo sounding like they're walking uphill on a dirt road and collapsing every other step from exhaustion. And Milena's deep voice, reminiscent of Jessie Sykes' nicotine-stained croon but with more quivering vibrato, staggers a couple steps ahead, bound for someplace dark and probably a little scary. The bedroom production on Seven Sisters is full, the electronics and samples combining with acoustic instruments and odd synths in that way that artists on Monika and Tomlab always seem adept, but the real draw is Milena's voice. She often doubles or triples it, almost as often adds a bit of processing to make it sound a hair less human, but these tweaks and layers exist mostly reinforce that she sounds very alone. This is a hermetic record, very much one person carefully making tracks alone in her apartment, even when guests chip in. Tord Lövik from the Riverendings duets on the gorgeous ""Love Feel You Do"", and with the slightly out-of-tune acoustic guitar zeroing in on a couple notes and the rolled-off high end it almost sounds like Jandek and Nancy covering some Townes Van Sant tune. It's romantic longing at its saddest and most fatalistic. While its solitary nature certainly works to Seven Sisters' advantage, sometimes it feels a bit too claustrophobic, hemmed-in to the point of queasiness. There's an odd cast to the production here, certain woozy samples of strings that seem about 4-bits deep and that stretch and contract at irregular intervals. Somewhere lurking inside ""Figs Tree"" is a straightforward murder ballad but the production is impossible to get a fix on, like a melodramatic film sound track recovered from a degraded print left to rot in the studio's basement. ""How Ode"" is even more warped, its backward music box and wildly distorted vocals that seem to waft out of one of some postmodern deconstruction of a Kurt Weill operetta. Milena has succeeded at constructing an odd and original gothic mood piece, but the headspace of Seven Sisters is the sort I'd only want to visit occasionally. ""Lily Wyatt"", a catchy acoustic pop song that stands out here like a starlight mint in a bowl full of razor blades, is the track here I keep returning to. That it works so well in a style outside the rest of the record suggests that Milena is an artist in control of her talent, ready to take it in different directions when so inclined.",Milenasong: Seven Sisters Album Review | Pitchfork,6.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

So Michael Pitt, the actor, was in a musical in 2001, Hedwig and the Angry Inch; contributed a song to the soundtrack of Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers as well as acted the film's lead; and played a Kurt Cobain stand-in in Last Days, Gus Van Zant's 2005 death flick. He is a pretty boy. His band, Pagoda, in which he plays guitar and sings, had their record released in February by Thurston Moore, who first met Pitt when they both worked on Larry Clark's Bully. Ryan Donowho, an ""O.C."" bit player and aspiring actor-- also plucked from the street, at which time he was playing drums as a street-musician-- played drums on the record before leaving the band for a nascent acting career. But it's not the youthful musical theater indiscretions, or the hipster bio, or the famous friends, or even the perception that he's an actor slumming acting like a musician that will make Pitt's record occasional tough going, but the fact that he once played Kurt Cobain in a movie and now sings like him on his debut CD. To my mind, there are worse crimes (say, ripping off Pearl Jam, and propagating that Eddie Vedder-howl all the way into the new century). And though some critics think that American pop-rock can have a second act only when filtered through a foreign country, accent, and wardrobe, I'd say uncomplicated ambition and admiration don't automatically make you a con man or a shill or a rip-off artist, but just a band that likes other bands and wants to become a band, too. Which is more or less how I hear Pagoda. Think, for instance, about the upcoming YACHT/Lucky Dragons Nirvana remix 12"", and why no one will have a problem with it. Lead single ""Lesson Learned"" does indeed sound like ""Rape Me"", including as referents an ascending refrain and muted power chords. Other Nirvanaisms are ""Amego""'s hyper-inarticulate ""Damn la la la la My Friend la la la la"" segue into ""blah blah blah blah,"" the one-to-two-word 1990s song titling, and ""Fetus"", which seems like it must be a Nevermind joke, right down to the junk cameo. It's also clearly a song about Michael Pitt's girlfriend/wife/lover getting an abortion. One interpretation here is that Pagoda are satirical geniuses-- ""Amego"" also interpolates snips of samples of serious sounding things such as weapon of mass destruction and war on terrorism while rhyming ""amego"" with ""loco"" and ""Mexico."" Other critical hotspots include ""Voices"", which has more than a little ""Bad to the Bone"" to it, Pitt doing a deadpan reading from what appears to be his journal in the final 10-minute opus ""I Do"", and the female orgasm noises that appear earlier in that song. Plus the junk, dope, and dope-sick talk, which is either totally appropriate or totally inappropriate for a record this heavily influenced by Nirvana. If all this makes you want to throw on some Nirvana and not some Pagoda, go ahead, but listening to this record, it occurs: what was the last band that really did sound like Nirvana? Their aspirations are so familiar as to be laughable until you realize why they're familiar. Pitt, a year older than me, has my generational preoccupations, unreconstructed. If he's moved on less than the rest of us, who could hate him for forming the band we once all wanted to be in?",Pagoda: Pagoda Album Review | Pitchfork,5.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Brooklyn's Palomar makes indie-pop sound like it wandered through a cloud of gamma radiation and wound up with superpowers: lurid muscles, torn jeans, the whole nine. Rachel Warren's singing is simple and tonally pure, with the same mix of velvety sweetness and skyscraping grandeur that makes boys swoon for Jenny Lewis and Tracyanne Campbell, and her lyrics tend toward the ambiguously lovelorn: There are songs about depleted relationships, like ""The Air Between Us""; songs about missed chances, like ""Bridge of Sighs""; and songs that don't seem to be about much of anything, like ""He Came to Stay"". Like Au Revoir Simone, the quartet knows how to ratchet up the euphoria of glossy harmonies with abrupt register shifts. Like Tilly and the Wall, they're fond of clattering, makeshift percussion: The cheery death wish ""Bury Me Closer"" features drummer Dale Miller banging on a bucket, for instance. But All Things, Forests has one quality that distinguishes Palomar from their precious peers-- the urge to rock the fuck out. Twee-leaning indie-pop tends to find a natural sonic parallel in gauzy and jangling tones, which are not absent from this album. Opener ""Bury Me Closer"" is relatively staid, with its watery organs and efflorescing vocal harmonies, although its spring-wound percussion and rangy bass render it taut. ""Surprise Us"" gently massages a two-note guitar twinkle and an acoustic strum toward an emphatic yet dreamy climax that's uncommon, but not entirely foreign, to this sort of indie-pop. You get a sense that Palomar had to actively restrain these songs from exploding into hooky rockers, as they seem so fond of the technique elsewhere. Most of the album displays a surprisingly delicate balance between adorability and raw power reminiscent of alt-rock revivalists Sybris. Palomar tempers their softer side with muscular percussion, hard-charging bass lines, and some of the starriest guitar pyrotechnics this side of Broken Social Scene. On ""Our Haunt"", a slinky minor-key guitar figure, ominous low-end, and squalls of feedback build tension for its sturdy main riff and chorus of crashing fuzz-chords, and Warren injects a dash of low-key gloom into her naturally sunny voice. This tension between the melodious and the strident recurs throughout the album: ""The Air Between Us"" goes out in a white-hot guitar blaze; ""Beats Beat Nothing"" slips limpid guitar tones into its churning rock drive; meandering rattlefest ""He Came to Stay"" squeals and transforms into an outsized stomper. Suddenly, the phrase ""twee as fuck"" sounds a little less ironic than it did before.","Palomar: All Things, Forests Album Review | Pitchfork",7.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

A review of The Velvet Underground & Nico in Boston's first rockzine,  Vibrations, suggested listeners put themselves in the frame of mind they might assume for Indian music. Of course, the Velvet Underground's narcotic repetitions-- influenced by John Cale's association with minimalist composer La Monte Young-- struck the mainline for a new style of pop, similarly connected to raga's enveloping drone. Uh, maybe you've heard of Can, Brian Eno, Sonic Youth, or My Bloody Valentine? When listening to A Sunny Day in Glasgow, it's perhaps best to put yourself in the frame of mind you might assume for those bands, too. Sure, this brother-sister trio aren't in the same league, but they're one of several exciting young acts keeping up ambient-pop's ethereal flame (a few years after M83 and others put their electronic spin on Loveless swoon). Where Atlanta's Deerhunter echo the psych-rock meditations of Spacemen 3, these Philadelphia tweegazers lose themselves in the trebly haze of early Creation Records, pop melodies barely shining through all the layers of noise. Then they kill you with ramshackle C86 adorableness. On Scribble Mural Comic Journal, A Sunny Day in Glasgowsculpt fluffy electronic textures, overdubbed funhouse-mirror guitars, and Kate-Bush-down-a-well vocals into a debut album that warps (and greatly improves upon) last year's self-released The Sunniest Day Ever EP. The project's founder, Ben Daniels of local ""supergroup"" King Kong Ding Dong, twists the sweetness in identical twins Lauren and Robin's voices into eerie new forms, whether off-kilter dial tones to open the thick-- and, hey, ringing-- ""A Mundane Phonecall to Jack Parsons"", echoing raindrops on ""Our Change Into Rain Is No Change at All (Talkin' 'bout Us)"", or stereo-panning schoolgirl chants amid alien guitars on ""C'Mon"" . The sisters' soft breathiness is most, well, breathtaking on cosmopolitan teenage lament ""The Horn Song"", or with gliding guitar, pebbly beats, and a moonstruck melody on album highlight ""5:15 Train"". Within A Sunny Day in Glasgow's aesthetic, their singing is less the point than the sonic environment they help create (for those gorgeous, submerged tunes!). So deceptively casual opener ""Wake Up Pretty"" dreams up the surreal-life dance party that is the ensuing ""No. 6 Van Karman Street"", and ""Ghost in the Graveyard"" begins with the pounding drums and background dissonance of an impassioned anthem by actual Glaswegians the Twilight Sad, then never develops into one. Meanwhile, ""Panic Attacks Are What Make Me 'Me'"" swells into a jingling alarum, shifting the details gradually enough to encourage what Eno called ""perceptual drift,"" and then suddenly changing direction. Dizzy? No, dazzled. As with Deerhunter's Cryptograms, A Sunny Day in Glasgow's debut becomes clearer as it nears an end. Album closer ""The Best Summer Ever"" at last distills the band's meteorological whorls into a psych-pop sunburst befitting its title. One of the band's older songs (it opened The Sunniest Day Ever EP) this track illustrates a notable divergence: While Deerhunter have moved toward tightly focused songs, the most recent recordings on Scribble Mural Comic Journal venture further into nuanced atmospherics.

Fantastic Damage, El-P's solo debut, was one of the first great albums released in post-9/11 America. It was tense and paranoid, and El-P seemed to be peering over his shoulder at the gathering storm. The album's production, blending waves of cacophony over broken rhythms, was similarly bleak. And while Fan Dam didn't anticipate everything-- who, aside from perhaps Donald Rumsfeld, could've foreseen the sanctification of torture as a tool of ""freedom""-- it did give form to our own feelings of dread and helplessness. Though I'll Sleep When You're Dead is (slightly) more textured and melodic than its predecessor, El-P's production is still amongst the most jarring in hip-hop, and his themes and shading remain pitched to black, haunted by the prospect of a dystopian near-future: Cigarettes are extinguished on wet palms, prisoners are raped before execution, and El-P-- our crazed, sometimes indecipherable narrator-- sticks his head out of a hoopde, screaming ""freedom is mine."" In this world, as in ours, we're coasting in the fast lane ""with doom and disease."" Like El-Producto says, ""The whole design got my mind crying."" ""Tasmanian Pain Coaster"", the album's first track, kicks off with a sample from Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. ""Do you think that if you were falling in space that you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?"" the first voice (Moira Kelley's Donna Hayward) asks. ""Faster and faster,"" heroine Laura Palmer replies. ""For a long time, you wouldn't feel anything. And you'd burst into fire, forever."" El-P spends 13 tracks exploring the freefalling fatalism of that quote. America is ablaze and El-P is fucked up from the floor up: ""Why should I be sober when God is so clearly dusted out his mind?"" the rapper asks on ""Smithereens"". The reply never comes, and he stumbles along like Rory Cochrane, too dazed to be angry or to put all the pieces together. On ""Drive"", he talks of a kid who ""fuel injected a speed ball,"" before later admitting with a wink ""my triple-A card has one too many initials."" The album works best at these moments, when it's sneering into the abyss and spitting out gallows humor. ""I stood up for the God's of ore mining/ In a military humvee with no bullet-proof siding,"" El-P raps on ""Drive"". Afterwards, a distant voice chimes in, ""sorry about that, guys"" as robotic backing vocals emerge from a miasma of corrosive, clunky rhythms to provide a mocking refrain of sorts. Elsewhere, lead-single ""Smithereens"" begins with a snippet of what could be a sunny, Bob Dorough track, before a voice interjects, ""Bring me the dramatic intro machine,"" and squishy horror synths introduce one of El-P's most caustic songs to date. But perhaps the most explicit instance of the album's dark humor comes at the end of ""Habeas Corpses"", which imagines El-P and guest rapper Cage as workers aboard a futuristic prison ship. Their task is to ""facilitate the end"" for the incarcerated. (From the gunshots sprinkled throughout, it's easy to imagine what that would entail.) ""It's almost romantic,"" Cage comments, but El-P doesn't share the enthusiasm. He's fallen in love with prisoner #247681Z, and his job is suddenly full of contradiction and nuance. He tries to escape, but of course escape is illusionary and temporary. ""Habeas Corpus"" is similar in spirit to Fantastic Damage's ""Stepfather Factory"", and provides a makeshift metaphor for our own country's desire for vindication and liberation. But, as the song fades, El-P is unwilling to cop to his own seriousness, and the track fades with him and Cage laughing off the drama they've just conjured. The jaded pose is a good look for El, and when the album tries to emote, such as on ""The Overly Dramatic Truth"", it falls flat on its face. The song is full of cringe-worthy lines such as ""you deserve the ignorance and bliss that I wish I still had,"" and is too emo for its own good. But when El-P sticks to what he knows-- chronicling the grime -I'll Sleep When You're Dead is every bit as good as its predecessor.

In the middle of Goliath, I'm On Your Side comes a moment that colors the entire record-- except it's not so much one moment as a handful of them that stretch over 18 minutes. ""Hummingbird/Indian Dog"" consists of soft guitar, loops, and drones that shimmer and rise to the sky, a mostly-wordless dreamspace made of the gentlest psychedelia. Once you hear it, it stays with you every time you play the record-- in the sturdier alt-country of ""The Devil Knows My Handle"", or the fragile ballads like ""Suddenly, It's You & Me"" where every instrument and every timbre in Syd Alexis' voice reveal cracks. This is one of those indie albums, a late-at-night, ostensibly vulnerable singer-songwriter thing where the auteur's friends step in to flesh out those simple arrangements with all the right touches-- a Mellotron here, pedal steel there. The rhythm section of Kimberlee Torres and Gregg Porter, Nathan Groth on guitar and vibes, and guests like Say Zuzu's Jon Nolan provide a fragile backdrop-- like the melody of ""Silver Waves Crash Through the Canyons"" that takes off on paper-maché wings, or opener ""Sad, Sad Army"", where Alexis' vocals open in a night-shift croak. But this isn't an album that coasts on its vibe. The dreaminess sometimes takes its toll: for some this will be a soft listen, maybe softer than the songs call for. The mellifluous synths of ""I Will Arrange For You To Fall II"" cradle you maternally, and a lullaby tone creeps in repeatedly. But the sublime state they achieve makes up for it. Two shorter instrumentals-- the brief ""Thicket"" and ""Oh, The Loneliness""-- feed the ambiance of ""Hummingbird/Indian Dog"", and together they give Alexis and gang a chance to set on tape the space rock field trips of their live shows. The songs are strong on their own, but these excursions give Hotel Alexis a chance to disappear into a dream for a while, and find out where it leads.","Hotel Alexis: Goliath, I'm On Your Side Album Review | Pitchfork",7.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Since the release of You Say Party! We Say Die!'s first album in 2005, the ante's been upped on their brand of fiery, female-led dance-punk. Blatantly spawned from the Pretty Girls Make Graves/YYYs c. 2004 model of aggro-new wave, their debut, Hit the Floor!, parlayed exclamatory song titles and chic leftist propaganda into a formidable album that dropped at a opportunistic time. The genre hasn't exactly experienced a sea change since, but new acts like Love is All and Be Your Own Pet have necessitated a more nuanced spin for dance party melee albums. Just ask Pretty Girls, Thunderbirds are Now! or Le Tigre-- you can milk one, maybe two, solid records by strictly adhering to the dance-spaz formula, but this fundamentalism ages poorly. Hit the Floor!, as rank and file as it was, provided the band with a number of potential aesthetic tangents for follow-up Lose All Time. They channeled Pretty Girls' complex histrionics while keeping a stake in gritty garage punk and buoyant Hot Hot Heat-style pop-- it was only a matter of further honing the sound that worked best. Lose All Time codifies these influences into a markedly more consistent effort, though the result's still strangely anti-climactic. Enthusiasm and the corresponding exclamation points are noticeably lacking on Lose All Time, and the band appears bent on maturing for maturity's sake. That's not to say sloganeering rockers like ""5 Year Plan"" or ""Poison"" don't have a pulse, but their breakneck austerity, when stretched over the span of an album, grows dull. ""Downtown Mayors Goodnight, Alley Kids Rule!"" and ""Opportunity"", while equipped with their share of explosive basslines and nifty hooks, demonstrate how much the band substitutes rote loud-soft dynamics for more original songwriting. The former even flaunts chorus riffs on an acidic level with Les Savy Fav, but it lacks that band's astute sense of rhythm, conceding instead to a vanilla verse that lackadaisically affixes high-hat sixteenths to a promising bassline. The story of Lose All Time is about what could have been. Right now this album's a great first draft, something to mull over before flipping these well-trodden ideas on their heads. To their credit, the band tries a few change-ups, most notably the faux-Stars track ""Monster"" and raw piano ballad ""Dance Floor Destroyer"". Dance-punk, however, can wear down as quickly as the hand-me-down Zildjian high-hats it features, and YSP!WSD! needs to stop treading water and put together a coup.

23,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10009-tongues/,2007-03-19T06:00:02,['Kieran Hebden'],Tongues,"The latest collaboration between Four Tet and the legendary drummer  enforces pop-like rules on their improvisations. Even if the work it's rendered hasn't always been remarkable, Kieran Hebden's path over the past three years warrants respect. In late 2004, Hebden-- as Four Tet-- finished his fourth LP, Everything Ecstatic, and released it the next year to wide acclaim. He'd become one of the few home-listening electronic musicians to find substantial popularity within the indie mainstream, but he didn't rest on his laurels. Instead, he got to work, producing an album by New England improvisers Sunburned Hand of the Man (out later this year) and devoting his talents to work with 63-year-old jazz/soul/rock drummer Steve Reid. Reid and Hebden went into the studio in March 2005, four days after first playing together, and emerged with two albums, The Exchange Session Vol. 1 and 2. Those sessions were all free, long-form improvisation, and-- as fascinating as Hebden and Reid could be sonically-- they certainly had their foibles as a nebulous duo. Hebden was playfully temperamental, his impatience causing him to jump the gun and storm the tape with sounds that didn't need to be there. It felt as though the then 25-year-old Hebden was still trying to learn to listen and respond. But Reid wasn't in a rush: Over the past four decades, he's played with James Brown, Fela Kuti, and Miles Davis, and The Exchange Sessions still found him fond of big, shifty grooves led with his sticky, trademark kick drum. The duo was strides better on Spirit Walk, recorded with a nonet for Soul Jazz in 2005. Hebden was improvising around people, hiding under a saxophone and reappearing alongside Reid's beat. Reid was a confident, ambitious bandleader. It worked. But Hebden and Reid return to duo work for Tongues, their pop album: In conversation, Hebden mentions that, in exploring his relationship with Reid, he became fascinated with Reid's interests, abilities and experiences in pop and rock. Reid, after all, played on Martha and the Vandella's 1964 hit ""Dancing in the Streets"". For Tongues, the duo puts temporal and thematic limits on its improvisations. Hebden introduced a pre-arranged melodic idea, and he and Reid improvised for approximately five minutes around each theme. Unfortunately, these restrictions cut the duo no favors. The very fundamental differences that marred The Exchange Sessions are more apparent for the Tongues concentrate: Reid is still older and wiser, and he acts like they have all of the time in the world here. His variations over Hebden's scrambled baritone sax samples for ""People Be Happy"" essentially involve adding cymbals to a tom-and-kick beat. He's equally metronomic on opener and single ""The Sun Never Sets"", refusing to step aside from his groove at all. Hebden, much the same hasty improviser as he was during The Exchange Sessions, tries to compensate. During the last minute of ""The Sun Never Sets,"" he smothers the melody with spirals of noise, forcing Reid out of the pocket and into an unnatural finish. He's directing the workflow, even when it doesn't need any help, forcing things into early exits through cacophonous finishes. Hebden goes wild to end most tracks, mistaking noisy washes for climaxes and cleansing. But that's only a symptom: The underlying problem here seems to be that Hebden still isn't comfortable in his own skin while improvising, with Reid or otherwise. Reid has called Hebden his musical soulmate, and that sounds like it could be true. But their relationship is still just young and promising. That's audible in the missteps on Tongues. Hebden issues retractions several times, as on the danceable ""Brain"". Otherwise one of the best tracks here, Hebden teases Reid's rhythm with flat electronic hums two minutes in, but-- after two tries-- he can't get it right. He throws the idea to the wind, eclipsing the rest of the track with a five-second sustain of the same tone, eventually breaking it and the track apart. Reid follows perfectly, but he shouldn't have to so early into the take. Sure, improvising doesn't require finding a course and sticking to it, but-- given a time limit for working around finite themes-- admissions of error sound like inexperience, immaturity, and a lack of confidence converging. Hebden's trying, and that's venerable enough. But, eventually, he's going to have to have to treat his improvisational undertakings like it's more than something he's doing to buck his own trends.",Kieran Hebden: Tongues Album Review | Pitchfork,4.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

And in ...* In one corner you have Richard Buckner, aka Sir Dark Invader, the Devotion + Doubt Demolisher, the Alt-Country Annihilator. And in the opposing corner is Jon Langford, aka the Fanglord, aka the Mekons Menace, the Waco Brothers Brawler. It's a match made not in heaven, but in Sally Timms's Chicago apartment, where in 2002 Buckner and Langford recorded eight of the nine songs on this one-off collaboration album, released on Langford's Buried Treasure Records. The title suggests there may have been some friendly competition involved, which seems almost inevitable given their distinct styles. Sir Dark Invader vs. the Fanglord pits Buckner's melting drawl against Langford's grainy vocals; Buckner's abstracted, introspective songwriting against Langford's demonstrative, outward-looking lyrics; Buckner's ragged beard against Langford's trimmed mustache. This amiable musical friction enlivens every song: pounding drums and punchy basslines jab at welterweight guitar melodies, and over the melee, Buckner and Langford move easily between lead and backing vocals and trade off instruments and solos almost on a whim. As a result, songs like the opener ""The Rolling of the Eyes"" and ""The Inca Princess"" generate brawling momentum-- the kind seldom associated with Buckner's solo material-- while tracks like ""Nothing to Show"" and the closer ""Do You Wanna Go Somewhere?"" sound battered and worn, but not necessarily defeated. The album is a volley of contradictions, a tossed-off collaboration (shelved for almost three years) that never sounds haphazard. The lighthearted aspects of the project-- songs like ""The Inca Princess"", the comic-book aliases, the photo-booth snapshots of both men that decorate the pixilated packaging-- disguise the gravity of the songs. ""Nothing to show for the things that I've done,"" Langford sings on the ruminative ""Nothing to Show"", ""There were places to go, and I had to choose this one."" Buckner takes over for the second verse, expressing an equally world-weary remorse. If they're pugilists on other songs, here they sound like hard-timers: singing ""We'll be lucky to leave/ Lucky to leave with our lives"", they sound like they're holding each other up, two drunks stumbling home from another long night at the bar. This feeling bridges the two-minute intermission, ""From Attic to Basement"", and continues on the standout ""Torn Apart"" and the raucous ""Inca Princess"". The former's tense rhythms echo the restlessness of its lyrics, as Buckner and Langfird share a rueful back-and-forth, singing the title over and over as the song winds down. ""The Inca Princess"" kicks up a barnstorming momentum as Langford describes a bar so tough that ""drinkin' and drivin' was almost mandat'ry."" By contrast, the conflicted lullaby ""No Tears Tonight"" and the abruptly abandoned ""Do You Wanna Go Somewhere?"" parse the isolation and the inspiration of a life devoted to music. ""I wanna wrap you up in music,"" Langford sings, then admits, ""But we both know that I got nothing/ Spent too much time playing in bands."" Taken together, these two tracks comprise a twist ending of sorts, revealing that Sir Dark Invader and the Fanglord have been fighting on the same side all along, battling the spectre of loneliness.

The Shins' James Mercer guests. For all of the pandemonium over the indie rock gold-record mainstream-radio-play explosion, few of the bands who breached Clear Channel's glass ceiling were actually longtime members of the small-label fraternity. The Shins and the Arcade Fire, to pick two of the bigger success stories, had relatively short histories before raising their profile beyond college campuses, while more seasoned groups with major-label money-sacks like Built to Spill and Mercury Rev never cracked the Billboard top 50. I could get all crotchety and bemoan this trend as the Johnny-Come-Latelies pulling the rug out from underneath the old vets, but it's more likely just a matter of younger bands sounding more enthusiastic on their second or third record and working with a fresher formula. Of course, Modest Mouse are the exception to this generalization, having scored in the hit-song jackpot 10 years and four full-length albums into their career. Perennially relegated to the second tier of the 90s indie-rock league (I still remember mis-learning of them as a BtS spinoff), modern rock chart-topper ""Float On"" allowed Isaac Brock to have the last laugh on his former indie label brethren, as he enjoyed the kind of crossover hit that's eluded so many major-label recruits since the heady days of grunge. What was even more astounding was the fact that Modest Mouse-- mob cries of ""sellout!"" notwithstanding-- didn't really compromise their sound for mass consumption: Brock's weird yelp-shout retained its volatile quaver, the band's punched-up rhythm section still sounded sharp and vital, and the hunt for cosmic guitar pedal settings still sounded like their driving passion. The album that gave birth to ""Float On"", Good News for People Who Love Bad News, was similarly unmitigated down to its mouthful title, but indicated that Brock wasn't treading water either, tweaking his sound to incorporate a touch of programming and the Tom Waits worship of his Ugly Casanova side project. We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank continues that measured consistency, preserving the core Modest Mouse sound despite the recruitment of historic guitar figure Johnny Marr while gently nudging toward new directions. Ironically, the most successful track on We Were Dead is the one that pushes hardest against the group's established formula: the almost gaudy single ""Dashboard"". With Modest Mouse's trademark itchy guitars all but drowned out by brass fanfares and slurring strings, ""Dashboard"" is the Vegas version of ""Float On"", and it works as an experiment to see just how far they can push the dissonance of Brock's multi-tracked barking against slick, commercially ambitious surroundings. Had the rest of the record gone further down this path of orchestration indulgence, it would've been either a classic or a disaster (just ask Trail of Dead, who've spent their time since Source Tags and Codes trying and utterly failing to create a similar kind of symphonic indie hard-rock). But instead of that dice-roll, We Were Dead continues to refine Brock's aesthetic, producing another solid (if not necessarily great) record. The development is clear in the way ""Parting of the Sensory"" smoothly evolves from foul-mouthed acoustic lament to boxcar-hobo hoedown, or on tracks like ""Fly Trapped in a Jar"", which takes an abrupt left turn halfway through from a dark, bristly screamer that echoes their earlier work to a jagged but dancey post-punk groove. Those latter moments are likely where Marr's much-anticipated influence is most obvious, but even then it's subtle; rather than impossibly sounding like the Smiths all of a sudden, the band has fun pilfering the rhythmic sheets of mid-period Talking Heads on songs like ""Education"" or ""Invisible"". So yes, despite the hefty presence of Marr, it's still undeniably Brock's band, and his development as a frontman is most apparent in his impressive inventory of vocal characters: There's ornery/shouty Brock, Waitsian-growl Brock, spoken-word proselytizer Brock, wounded/reflective Brock, and countless permutations of all of these. Many of those personae appear in the same song or even the same line, singing backup to each other on opener ""March Into the Sea"" or allowing the singer to play call-and-response with himself on ""Parting of the Sensory"". And when Brock can't modulate his throat quite as sweetly as he'd like, he calls in the Shins' James Mercer, whose counterpoint on ""Florida"" and the excellent ""We've Got Everything"" help put a couple of strong follow-up singles in the can. Unless my radio barometer is totally out of whack, 2007 should be another banner year for the disorienting experience of hearing Modest Mouse sandwiched between Fergie and Fall Out Boy, not to mention covered on ""American Idol"". There's no reason this development should be met with scorn; if anything, Modest Mouse should be championed for exposing a larger audience to a sound in line with classic indie rock, rather than aiming for more traditional rock sounds like many of their more accessible indie contemporaries. That a window has briefly opened in the greater cultural consciousness to make room for Modest Mouse on the airwaves would have been unthinkable at the start of the decade; that they've remained so true to their core aesthetic in light of the temptation that success undoubtedly brings is rarer still.",Modest Mouse: We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank Album Review | Pitchfork,7.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

David Terry, piercing pop crooner and lead singer of Aqueduct, has transformed his sound on his third album, second for Barsuk. Leaving the peddling energy of the drum machine for dirtier synths and guitars, Terry retains the piano, capturing the brightest, most nostalgically 1990s elements of his earlier work. Or Give Me Death begins with ""Lying In the Bed I've Made"", a monumental and aching fanfare that wouldn't sound out of place on Menomena's impressive Friend or Foe. The dizzying elegance of the piano line as it jumps deftly around a minor scale is coaxed into a predictable atmosphere by Terry's voice, a powerful Grohl-aping whine. A change to major key for a thumping, radio-ready chorus only hammers this home, and this opener quickly becomes a drab premonition of the rest of the album. ""Living A Lie"" is a strong second track, again hinging its power on a darting, synthesized melody and, as a counterpoint, a surprising wash of guitars. But this transitory piece drifts into emo territory for the chorus, where guitars and vocals spit out angry dissonances and static noise with little reserve. On previous releases, where Terry was working as a solo artist, the use of synthesizer and drum machine led to playful, half-cooked, half-rehearsed, and ultimately danceable cuts. Even his more serious tracks, like piano montage ""The Suggestion Box"" from 2005's I Sold Gold, succeeded in driving home the earnest feelings of their narrator without pushing it. But push it these new messages do, with more dramatic, yet simpler tales and a more fervent adherence to a pop piano aesthetic owned by the likes of Billy Joel. The lilting keyboard syncopation on ""Keep It Together"" and wistful strings on ""Just the Way I Are"" borrow Joel's thick, happy chords and troubled romantic's vocal addresses, making these songs a joy only for being slightly refreshing facsimiles. Aqueduct's most relaxed numbers are the strongest, where guitar, piano, and synth fuse in rare harmony. The doomsday upright bass and spacebound synth on the strongest track, ""Unavailable"", harness the newfound power of the band. In the slow jam ""Zero the Controls"" Terry has made a lo-fi and sexy jam reminiscent of 2003's Power Ballads, as he combines digitized percussion, a twittering flute sample, thick drums, backup saxophones, and a lazy, bitcrushed vocal melody. In the adagio range Terry creates the best work on the album. He's still serenading a love subject, but losing some the man-and-piano clichés with points and counterpoints that are colorful and melodically surprising. Here, in a handful of instances, he blends the strengths of his favorite instruments instead of holding simplistic competitions between them.",Aqueduct: Or Give Me Death Album Review | Pitchfork,5.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
27,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10012-out-of-the-woods/,2007-03-21T05:00:01,['Tracey Thorn'],Out of the Woods,"It's been a while since anyone's heard from Everything But the Girl's Tracey Thorn. In fact, it's been nearly a decade since Everything But the Girl's 1999 Temperamental, after which the duo went on extended hiatus and, perhaps more accurately, singer Thorn went on extended maternity leave. Sure, there was an EBTG best-of, and Thorn (with her longtime partner Ben Watt) curated a Back to Mine comp. But no one had heard a freshly recorded peep from Thorn until she resurfaced singing with Tiefschwarz on their 2006 Fabric mix. Still, that's nothing compared to the wait to hear from Tracey Thorn, solo artist. No one's heard from Tracey Thorn, solo artist, since her barely-there 1982 debut A Distant Shore, after which she teamed with Watt to form Everything But the Girl and moved on to bigger, better, and altogether more fleshed-out things. But with Watt off gallivanting around the globe as an in-demand DJ and the kids apparently okay to go, Thorn has finally returned to the studio for another stab at flying solo. Needless to say, much has changed since 1982, both in Thorn's life as well as in Thorn's music, with the biggest difference between then and now probably Everything But the Girl's unlikely flirtation and ultimate intersection with house music. The merger transformed the group from sophisti-pop cult act to clubland favorites, not only earning the duo its biggest success to date but ensuring its perennial spot on countless dance comps. No surprise, then, that many of those dance elements have returned along with Thorn on Out of the Woods. But this is no club record; instead it nicely encapsulates Thorn's best quality-- the unlikely diva and cosmo chanteuse, wrapped up in one-- while doing its darndest to prove as unchallenging as possible. It's a disc better suited to a relaxing afternoon shopping for jeans than a sweaty night out. In a sense Thorn was fortunate that few outside the rabidly faithful were clamoring for a comeback, as the greatest advantage of making an album no one expected is that you're able to make an album free from expectations. That's a benefit most veterans would kill for, and at least initially Thorn takes advantage of the clean slate. The opener ""Here It Comes Again"" is a gorgeously pastoral piece of chamber folk that does justice to Thorn's evocative lyrics. ""The sun coming through the rain is more precious than God,"" she sings, and if you close your eyes and sit still for a bit, that image comes across perfectly clear through the mix of English countryside melancholy and heavenly beauty. Sticking to such a subdued internalized mood would have taken some courage, especially for a comeback record, so maybe it's not as surprising as it is a little disappointing that Thorn chooses to play it safe, taking much of the rest of the record indoors for a series of mostly standard-issue dance tracks that range from good to fine to perfunctory but never quite achieve the tacit goal of most club music: euphoria. The downtempo schoolyard taunt chronicle ""A-Z"" starts things out on a strong note, the pointed lyrics of ""small town hell"" compensating for Ewan Pearson's 1980s-meets-90s production (it's like Bronski Beat's ""Smalltown Boy"" at half speed). The actually pretty excellent ""It's All True"" continues on the decidedly retro track, with self-consciously dated squiggling synth squiggles and percussion flourishes as timeless as they are anonymous. With ""Get Around to It"" the album gets a bit of second hand inspiration from Arthur Russell, whose track gets remade as a funky disco rave-up that features the Rapture's saxophonist Gabe Andruzzi squonking away. But after that early (musical) peak, ""Hands Up to the Ceiling"" brings it back down again, or at last back inward, and Thorn's suddenly warm glimmer of heart and directly personal sentiment fulfills the promise of ""Here It Comes Again"", the mellow trip down memory lane name checking ""Siouxsie Sioux and Edwyn, too,"" while incorporating the requisite references to rain coming down ""on a cold grey town."" It's like a UK indie ""In My Room"" (Beach Boys or Weezer, take your pick). ""Easy"" marks the shift back to downtempo dance, all space swooshes and low squelches, but it's hard to imagine this is the music the (we assume) teenage Thorn of ""Hands Up to the Ceiling"" turns to when it's time to escape. It's solidly constructed, but at the same time the song's almost oppressively generic. The same could be said for ""Falling Off a Log"", whose spooky Omnichord chimes are all that sets it apart from what could be a slick, safe, boutique friendly remix. The throbbing ""Grand Canyon"" makes Thorn sound like a guest on her own album. Thus the pretty ""By Piccadilly Station I Sat Down and Wept"" again interrupts to underscore what the rest of the album has already evinced. Here Thorn's at her best, and her barest, both musically and emotionally, allowing her voice to take precedent over the beats rather than serve as a mere supporting player. Were the rest of the album this consistently mellow, the concluding ""Raise the Roof"" might have had a greater effect, a glimmer of optimism that washes away the gloom. Instead it's just another upswing of the album's back-and-forth cover the bases pace. The difference is that on this final track, you can practically hear Thorn smiling as she allows herself to cautiously warm up, leaving behind the restrictions of chill out music for something a little more fun and loose. In context it sounds like nothing so much as the kind of soundtrack fodder that plays as the credits roll. A chick flick, no less, after the personal touches of the screenplay have been market tested and twisted through numerous permutations until what's left is perfectly serviceable and never less than pleasant, but still suspiciously closer to product than what the writer might have originally intended. At this point in her career, Thorn shouldn't be courting the middle, and considering the best moments on Out of the Woods, she didn't have to, either.",Tracey Thorn: Out of the Woods Album Review | Pitchfork,5.6,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Georgia cultivates a particularly introverted breed of indie singer-songwriter, especially if the artist in question is female and plays an acoustic guitar, if she whispers shyly and coyly into the mic, and if she writes self-deprecating lyrics that reveal her insecurities. Listening to Madeline's new mini-album The Slow Bang, which follows her 2003 debut Kissing and Dancing, it's impossible not to hear Atlanta-born Chan Marshall or Rome's Liz Durrett, who both share her home state as well as her penchant for hushed vocals and minimal arrangements. Madeline is more playful, certainly, and less shy than either, acting like she might actually enjoy the attention that performing and recording bring. So songs like the disarming opener ""Sleeping Dogs"", the nearly anthemic ""Good Houses"", and delicate closer ""Simple Words"" sound lively even when they're barely there and mordantly witty when they're most sincere. She probably even addresses the audience when she plays them live. Unfortunately, Madeline often treats precocity as an end in itself. Again and again on The Slow Bang, she falls for the showy line or the look-at-me phrasing. On ""Fish in the Sea"", which features a choir of Georgia crickets supporting one of her beguiling melodies, she actually sings, ""I've been huntin' and bitches be frontin'/when they limp like some wounded beast."" That the song is comforting a lovelorn friend only makes it sound more ironic and therefore more problematic. Her quirky poise falls away, and Madeline sounds like another sorority girl with a fruity-drink buzz flashing gang signs and peppering her slurred speech with dawg. That moment-- a gouge in the canvas-- nearly ruins the entire album. However, it does show that Madeline is in the world, not apart from it. Rather than shutting herself in her bedroom to write and record-- which is the impression many of her peers, Georgian or not, give-- Madeline draws gregariously from her indie contemporaries, which gives her a surprisingly large musical vocabulary. The Slow Bang is, after all, released by Orange Twin, which is run by Elf Power, and features significant contributions from Matthew Houck of Athens-based Phosphorescent. ""Uncle's Sweetheart Pt. 2"" begins with Madeline playing acoustic and singing plaintively (i.e., no different than most other songs here), but then curveballs into a roots-rock, gospel-derived chorus that wouldn't be out of place on a Mary Chapin Carpenter song. That's no dig-- it's the largest, warmest moment on the album. On the other hand, that same worldliness motivates her to attempt a song like ""The Demise of Madame Butterfly"", whose clunky theatricality not only annoys listeners, but distances them from the artist. Madeline ought to let the Decemberists be the Decemberists. She has enough personality to make a whole album just by being herself.",Madeline: The Slow Bang Album Review | Pitchfork,6.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Jesse Sykes knows what you want: ""Tell me what you need to see,"" she sings elegantly on ""Eisenhower Moon"", the first track on her third album. The answer: ""half sadness, half fury."" That Like Love Lust and the Open Halls of the Soul will veer more toward fury than sadness doesn't become apparent until the second song, ""LLL"" (one of two de facto title tracks), which builds to a forceful conclusion that would have been unthinkable on either of the band's previous albums. Where those records trafficked a lustrous yet monlithic folk rock that matched Sykes' voluminous voice, Like Love Lust and the Open Halls of the Soul, on the other hand, is just as adventurous as that lengthy title promises, changing up moods and music and taking Sykes and the band outside their comfort zone: from the skipping indignation of ""You Might Walk Away"" and the outright outrage of ""I Like the Sound"" to the psychedelic wonder of ""Spectral Beings"" to the gentle gospel drift of ""The Air Is Thin"". The band incorporates an impressive array of styles and sounds-- SoCal pop, desert rock, country, and folk-- into these songs to create its own ""cosmic American music,"" to borrow Gram Parsons' phrase. Certainly they want to expound upon the past, not to replicate it, which makes Like Love Lust their most adventurous album to date, and in some ways their most calculated and self-conscious. Sykes' voice, which sounds like Marianne Faithfull's if she'd hailed from the American Southwest, is the perfect instrument for communicating this concoction of emotions, but in finding new ways to use her voice, her reach occasionally exceeds her grasp. She never sounds entirely comfortable among the handclaps on the upbeat ""You Might Walk Away"" or the Fifth Dimension bum-bumbumbum-ba's on the jarring ""I Like the Sound"" or the loungey horns on ""Aftermath"". On the other hand, she's right at home singing the la la la's of ""Station Grey"" and sighing the airy backdrop of ""Spectral Beings"", as grainy and atmospheric as a Jarmusch film. Sykes creates a choir of herselves on ""How Will We Know?"", which builds to a lovely desert coda-- one of the album's many potential showclosers. By contrast, Sykes's songwriting voice is never as coolly confident on Like Love Lust as her physical voice. Over three albums, however, she has developed a flair for elliptical imagery, giving the impression that she writes as a means to search for some larger truth. If Sykes' quest leads her to vague sentiments about raindrops on broken glass and the soul's open corridors, more often than not it makes the songs sound even more earthily enigmatic. Even though Sykes gets first billing, her three albums are as much about the Sweet Hereafter as they are about her. The rhythm section of Bill Herzog and Eric Eagle rumble dependably, and Anne Marie Ruljancich's violin hovers curiously throughout the album. In ex-Whiskeytowner Phil Wandscher especially, she's found an ideal musical partner, the Emmylou to her Gram Parsons. Wandscher's playing sounds looser and even more central to the songs than on previous efforts. ""LLL"" builds to a close on his whitewater solo, and ""Hard Not to Believe"" rumbles sensuously with his descending chords. Especially at the end of ""How Will We Know?"" and ""Station Grey"", his guitar and Sykes's voice intertwine naturally and closely, striking the perfect equilibrium on an album that often feels out of balance.",Jesse Sykes & the Sweet Hereafter: Like Love Lust and the Open Halls of the Soul Album Review | Pitchfork,6.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Since forming Axolotl in 2004, Karl Bauer has continually proven he can do anything with a drone. On nearly 20 records made mostly alone, he has explored texture, ambience, aggression, and rhythm, without ever sounding generic or indistinct. Memory Theatre compiles three of his hardest-to-find releases-- 2006's ""Chemical Theatre"" 12-inch and 2005's Oranur and Object Phantom CD-Rs-- which sound even better together than they did apart. That's because the more you listen to Axolotl, the more recurring ideas and patterns you discover. Bauer's approach is simple: thick drones made with violin, electronics, and voice, sometimes accompanied by primitive percussion. The key to his hypnotic music isn't volume or density, but the way he mixes sounds and builds momentum. As with Fennesz or Tim Hecker, his pieces have a song-like logic, but they're more like paintings than tunes, with independent layers blended into picturesque wholes. Memory Theatre opens with ""Chemical Theatre"", an eight-minute stretch of oscillating tones that rub together like sheets of sandpaper. Rough and textured, it launches Memory Theatre into a stretch of heavy, tactile pieces. On ""Oranur"", groaning violins and a clacking beat (from William Sabiston, who provides percussion on five tracks) evoke Tony Conrad jamming with A Handful of Dust. Bauer's violin remains a primal weapon; here it sounds like a jagged saw, but elsewhere it evokes a violent storm, a choral hymn, and even a howling voice. ""Lake Garden"" follows with bells and chimes mixed into an insistent storm, and that urgent vibe crests on ""Kingdom of Ends"", whose tribal rumbling slowly melts into elongated moans. These first four tracks together feel like a spooky outdoor séance, with each sound doing double duty as music and atmosphere. Bauer shifts his tone with the middle track, ""Anomalon"". As glitchy, bubbling sounds replace previous tension with calm, the album launches into outer space with no intention of returning. The whirring wind of ""Natura Naturans"" recalls the ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite"" passage of Stanley Kubrick's 2001, while ""Bions"" uses morse-code-like beeps to suggest what Stars of the Lid might sound like to a Martian picking up transmissions across the galaxy. Clearly, it's easy to go overboard with the ideas and images that Bauer's work inspires, but that's a testament to his wide sonic range. Memory Theatre may not be Axolotl's best album (last year's Way Blank is a bit sharper), but as a representation of all the pictures Bauer can paint, it's hard to imagine a more complete portfolio.",Axolotl: Memory Theatre Album Review | Pitchfork,7.9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
31,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10016-armchair-apocrypha/,2007-03-23T06:00:01,['Andrew Bird'],Armchair Apocrypha,"Chicago violinist and songwriter follows his breakthrough album, The Mysterious Production of Eggs, by adding more guitars and deeper textures to his production, tricks he's been employing live for the past couple of years. At first blush, this record is not nearly as captivating as Andrew Bird's previous three albums, but in his inimitable and subtle way, the Chicago singer-songwriter has here made yet another intricately detailed collection of songs. While Weather Systems and The Mysterious Production of Eggs found him discovering and exploring new territory, this is the album where he's built his house and now settles in and gets comfortable. In a subgenre stuffed full with mediocrity, Bird has developed a singular style that frees him to add or subtract anything he likes from it-- no matter what he does at this point, chances are you're never going to mistake his music for anyone else's. On Bird's latest album, Armchair Apocrypha, guitar is far more prominent than it once was-- something Bird has been working toward in concert for a couple of years now. This addition deepens the texture created by his core instruments-- pedal-controlled loops of pizzicato violin, drums, and glockenspiel. With the addition of overdubs-- waves of multi-tracked violin, eerie whistling, and dizzying violin cadenzas-- and heavy layering, it all becomes nearly symphonic in scope. The only thing that tosses and turns more than the music is Bird-- his lyrics are drawn from the kinds of thoughts that keep one up at night: ""Do you wonder where the self resides/ Is it in your head or between your sides?/ Who will be the one who decides/ Its true location?"" he sings on ""Darkmatter"", pondering the unknowable without resorting to pedestrian uses of the words ""soul"" and ""God."" His wordplay is in top form and serves as a perfect foil for the tension and release of arrangements like that on ""Armchairs"", where a piano pushes around chunks of listless violin. Oddly, Bird revisits a song from 2003's Weather Systems, his first album without former band the Bowl of Fire: ""Imitosis"" is built around a much faster version of the violin parts and vocal hook of Weather Systems' ""I"", but apart from those ingredients it's completely different-- and much better. The song takes a spiraling dive into Bird's interest in science and psychology and his distrust of the ways in which we use them in our world, spinning into an examination of the nature vs. nurture debate. These trips through a conflicted superego may not work quite as well without Bird's sonic stamp, or his voice. His singing can leap from a low deadpan to a flying falsetto in a heartbeat, and he varies his verses and choruses to throw you slightly off balance before serving his precisely delivered hooks. Bird never takes a melody where you expect it to go, as on the chorus of ""Plasticities"", which is practically power pop with its snappy guitar hook and massive vocal melody, but the way it's recorded and arranged it gets under your skin more than it gets into your head. ""Scythian Empires"" is one of the most subtle and elegant songs about the futility of battle and conquest written during the current Iraq War, linking brief mentions of Halliburton attaché cases and talk of ""exiting empires"" to an ancient, extinct civilization. The Scythians controlled vast swaths of modern-day Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan for around eight centuries but now are all but forgotten-- Bird's indirect connection of them to the imagery of the last four years shows the sweep of history that speedily ushers most of our endeavors to the dustbin, and he does it without beating us over the head. If there's a disappointing moment on the record, it's when ""Heretics"" pulls back from the drama of its swirling intro and slips into a mixture of spoken and sung lines instead of just going hell-for-leather to a big chorus. Otherwise, the biggest criticism you could level at it is that it's not better than the three albums that came before it-- but that scarcely matters when you're actually listening to it, because Armchair Apocrypha is ultimately another object of strange and unique beauty from this inventive songwriter and performer.",Andrew Bird: Armchair Apocrypha Album Review | Pitchfork,7.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
32,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10017-sound-of-silver/,2007-03-20T05:00:00,['LCD Soundsystem'],Sound of Silver,"Best new music James Murphy offers his second multi-track album as LCD Soundsystem, and it's as close to a perfect hybrid of dance and rock music's values as you're likely to ever hear. James Murphy started releasing dance music some time between ""B.O.B."" and ""Get Ur Freak On"". It was a golden age for modern pop, a period during which a lot of personal aesthetics crumbled. Indie wasn't a dirty word, but it was a meaningless one. Pop, though, wasn't just more meaningless, it was more everything. And for the first time in a long while, pop also had its evangelicals; people who could argue convincingly in its favor, and who knew how to contextualize it interestingly. That turnover period was an exciting time; the ideological tension, the feeling that something was at stake, the exuberance of redrawing your bounds. The habitual mixtape maker in your life probably remembers it well. Despite eventually remixing Britney Spears and N.E.R.D., Murphy never had a hands-on relationship with pop. Nonetheless, his transition out of punk and into dance music ran concurrent with this modest revolution, and it's pretty much impossible to separate his epiphanies from ours. That early LCD tracks like ""Losing My Edge"" used to feature in playlists alongside, say, ""Work It"" or ""...Baby One More Time"" only reinforces the link. So it's fitting that the finest work of Murphy's career is an album that sits squarely at the intersection of all those careening ideologies. Sound of Silver, his second as LCD Soundsystem, is as close to a perfect hybrid of dance and rock music's values as you're likely to ever hear. These days, there isn't as much to talk about. It feels like less is up for grabs, as if music fans are gripped by a general fatigue. I'm not sure if you rapidly skim the same articles as I do, but apparently 72% of the internet is now made up of free mp3s, while another 14% is accompanying blurbs. Sometimes, I don't know how you guys do it. We're besieged and stupefied enough by downloads and mixes and remixes and mashups and collections of songs masquerading as albums that an album that feels like an album strikes me as positively ideal right now. Thankfully, Murphy-- a self-confessed 1970s rock nerd who grew up in the heyday of art-rock and albums as Statements-- unapologetically sets out to make dance records that breathe like proper albums. In that respect, Sound of Silver isn't far removed from LCD Soundsystem's eponymous 2005 debut, which ultimately tried to do the same thing but fell slightly short. While Sound of Silver makes no bones about Murphy's well-known appreciation of Brian Eno's pop vocal affectations (""Get Innocuous"", ""Sound of Silver""), the Velvet Underground (""New York I Love You""), or new-wave (""Watch the Tapes""), it never feels like a paste job, but rather just the well-considered work of someone connecting the dots between the past and the present. There's not a single weak track here, and many more already feel classic. ""Sound of Silver"" is a seven-minute suite that morphs from a rumbling, ice-cold, no-wave groove into a liquefied jumble of kalimbas, pianos, and fizzy synths. ""All My Friends"" begins with a piano riff that sounds not unlike a speeding train (or, at least, Steve Reich's approximation of one) and rolls downhill into fireworks. And then there's the song that precedes it, and with which it combines to form the record's center. A sleek, delicate, and effortlessly melodic sliver of electro, ""Someone Great"" is my favorite song of the year so far, and constitutes new ground for Murphy both in terms of prettiness and poignancy. It's about loss, but the lyric remains tantalizingly ambiguous. As with most great songs, its best lines buzz around the edges of the story: ""The worst is all the lovely weather/ I'm stunned it's not raining/ The coffee isn't even bitter/ Because, what's the difference."" Murphy used to court spontaneity by refusing to pre-write any of his lyrics before going into the vocal booth, claiming in interviews that they were all ad-libbed. It's a strategy he's evidently abandoned on Sound of Silver, and the record is much better for it. On ""All My Friends"", for instance, he tackles a favorite subject (getting older) from the wrong end of an all-nighter: ""You spend the first five years trying to get with the plan/ And the next five years trying to be with your friends again."" On ""North American Scum"", he tackles continental divide with straight deadpan: ""Well I don't know, I don't know where to begin/ we are North American/ And for those of you who still think we're from England / we're like... 'No.'"" When it's all said and done, Murphy's real legacy to dance music will be his production sense. He's an analog obsessive with a general aversion to software, and Sound of Silver reflects that. Far removed from the compressed, trebly, and overmastered paradigm that's gripped electronic music in the last decade, Sound of Silver sounds deep, spacious, and full-blooded. (Like, um, an old rock record.) It's an absolute joy to listen to, for every possible reason, not the least of which is because, these days, those epiphanies feel like they're coming fewer and farther between.",LCD Soundsystem: Sound of Silver Album Review | Pitchfork,9.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
33,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10018-living-with-the-living/,2007-03-21T05:00:02,['Ted Leo and the Pharmacists'],Living With the Living,"More expansive and prettier than anything this D.C. band has done yet, the group's fifth album sounds most like a step on from 2001's The Tyranny of Distance, which was the sound of R.E.M.-style jangle pulled taut until it turned to punk. Ted Leo, one of rock's last great intellectual populists, likes to throw you. Now on his fifth album, Living With the Living, the thirtysomething rocker still prefers the same music he's probably loved since his teens: the smarty-pants punk and new wave of turn-of-the-1970s UK labels like Stiff; the amped-up rhythm'n'soul of 60s mod and ska; the rangy heavy rock of Thin Lizzy; the hard-strumming folksiness of 80s indie; and the idealism impressed on him by American hardcore. The Pharmacists' oeuvre is all of a two-toned piece, but each record stands on its own, just different enough from its predecessor. So while I haven't lived with Living for very long, it's steadily grown on me, making me want to rave louder about it than it may deserve. Call me a booster rather than a critic, but I love Ted Leo and the Pharmacists and seriously want this band be, like, fucking huge. But at the same time, and call me old-fashioned, it's honorable the way Leo has opted to grow his audience and his songwriting talent organically-- and watch both increase exponentially, on his own terms. I like that he's got ethics and ideals that go beyond lifestyle choices. I like that he sees writing the most compassionate song possible about eating disorders as a political act, because it is. And with its airtight rhythm section and the crackling energy of its bug-eyed frontman in his Conflict T-shirt, no rock band currently touring puts on a better live show than the Pharmacists. On stage is where the looser songs of Living With the Living will ultimately live or die. More expansive-- for better or worse-- and prettier than anything Leo's done yet, the record is most closely related to 2001's The Tyranny of Distance, which was the sound of R.E.M.-style jangle stretched tight until it turned to punk. Like most punk lifers, Leo's music expresses a big-hearted emotional openness, but sonically, punk has also made him a solid editor, suspicious of bullshit ornamentation. ""The Sons of Cain"" is one of the better examples of his skill here: Its driving cowpunk finds flashes of Chuck Berry in Leo's licks, handclaps, and a sharp piano run tucked neatly in the mix, plus some ecstatic, throat-shredding whooping at the climax. As usual, Leo knows how to start strong, too, opening Living with three sure shots in a row-- especially ""Army Bound"", with its wicked solo. Leo's always had a bit of guitar hero in him, usually confining it to the one- or two-note rave-ups that smart punk bands hold to the fade-out. But where he once shaved his songs to their communicative essentials, here he's getting loose, mostly because when bands get suppler, more responsive, and more technically accomplished they're apparently entitled to stretch out. Like, you know, the Clash. It's an old rock band move that fails as much as it succeeds. For example, after four minutes of actual song, the outro to ""The Lost Brigade"" is three-and-a-half minutes of one note-- and not a particularly engaging note, either. You can skip the reggae trifle ""The Unwanted Things"", a momentum-killer on an album with an already wobbly sense of pacing. You can also pass over the awful political jeremiad ""Bomb. Repeat. Bomb."", which my Leo-loving drinking buddy disparagingly described as Blink 182 trying to be Crass (though I wouldn't be that rude to either Crass or Blink 182). Strangely, for such a sharp political eye and such an obvious humanist as Leo, the lyrics seem to be attacking the young bomber pilots, not the political quagmire that put those bombers in the air. And though Leo's fingerpicking is lovely and the melody's memorable, the tin whistle break in ""A Bottle of Buckie"" verges on Celtic kitsch. When playing to his strengths, though, Leo's songwriting is as strong as ever. Joe Strummer would appreciate the riffs on ""Who Do You Love?"", which climaxes in a stirring outro straight out of ""Safe European Home"" and indulges Leo's own mannerisms to great effect. (See also the short, sharp ""The World Stops Turning"".) ""The Toro and the Toreador"" should have been the album's closer; it's the climatic, rousing yelp of Tyranny's ""You Could Die (Or This Might End)"" with years of experience behind it, stretched out into a six-minute slow burn that milks the peaks of big melodramatic ballads for all they're worth. And ""La Costa Brava"" may be the best thing the Pharmacists have recorded yet, Leo's version of an epic, radio-ready, quiet/loud/quiet modern rock song. So despite a pretty high hit/miss ratio, as a big-step-forward record, Living ain't exactly Armed Forces. Maybe that's because, instead of being in thrall to fastidious (for which you can read ""British"") writers of single-length punk songs, Living often sounds like Leo's most American record to date, its unabashed big-ness more like Jersey boy Leo is still living under the towering shadow of the dude who made Born to Run. And like Bruce, to whom he's frequently been compared and whom he's covered live, even when Leo's attempts at big statements and big songs flop on Living, that same big-hearted openness makes you want to, rightly or wrongly, forgive his excesses. Even at his most impassioned and over the top, you never catch glimpses of Leo molting at some point into Bono. But I continue to slot Leo in the ""hero"" column, and despite Living's indulgences and occasionally soggy bottom half, I also continue to wish him well in his quest to win the world over, one kid at a time.",Ted Leo and the Pharmacists: Living With the Living Album Review | Pitchfork,7.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

Apparently Tom Lax of the venerably awesome Siltbreeze label was minorly miffed that Pitchfork somehow missed Times New Viking's first album, 2005's Dig Yourself. So call this oversight correction, because I fucking love TNV. Dig Yourself was, famously, the first new release on Siltbreeze in a bazillion years, after Lax had mothballed the label that had brought us such head-rearranging 90s noise-rock totems as the Dead C's Harsh 70s Reality, Harry Pussy's Ride a Dove, and dozens more. Times New Viking, three pain teens from Ohio punning on fonts, are another remaindered irregular tweed suit off the label's rack. If the group's thrashing pop flair and shouty boy-girl vocal tradeoffs initially feel a little, well, hooky to stand alongside such cap-peeling titans as Mssrs. Russell, Morley, and Yeats, do not forget that Siltbreeze also released singles by the likes of Guided By Voices and was deeply steeped in the scratchy kiwi pop aesthetic. And the opening drums on ""Imagine Dead John Lennon"" (now that's a song title)-- the lead track from Present the Paisley Reich, TNV's second album-- sound like hammered aluminum, and the rest of the song, all 1:36 of it, seems as if it was recorded with one tin can in Ohio, the other tin can in Dunedin, and the twine dredged across the silty bottom of the Pacific. I wouldn't blink if you told me that the pressing plant actually used dryer lint or dead leaves to conserve petroleum; the album's sparkling multi-hued murk and wet paper flatness will have you cranking the volume in iTunes. Paisley Reich recalls everything from the Swell Maps' bedroom odes to Gerry Anderson to Huggy Bear's claustrophobically recorded teenpocalypse rave-ups, and from the snotrocket twee of the Vaselines to the musky, druid's glen fog that hung over the production of the Fall's Slates. And the songs are pop-punk gnashing and snarling and droning with all the sexual frustration-- ""Teenagelust!"" goes one title, and note the exclamation point-- and delicious ennui that's been surgically removed from the radio version. Times New Viking write the kind of terse, bitingly smart lyrics too smart to be buried in 10 million pounds of sludge from New York and New Jersey, but hopefully you'll just listen harder. So they caterwaul, ""I don't want to die in the city alone"" and reject a lonely death with frantic cymbals and keyboards like needles in a camel's eye. 30 seconds before the end of ""Ladders"" the whole song shifts, jump-cuts, or changes channels, from distant noise to, like, louder noise. They bring out a Nuggets/""96 Tears"" organ that they play like a cloddish Terry Riley on ""Hiding in Machines"". And forget this era of emo concept double albums and epic Neon Bible-style chest-beating; Paisley Reich is finished and done in 28 minutes. If you think that indie rock preens too much these days, Times New Viking probably sport bruises and scraped knees, and if you think it was all over for Pavement after ""Forklift"", TNV's lo-fi skree and bounce will certainly shake your love shack.",Times New Viking: Present the Paisley Reich Album Review | Pitchfork,8.2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
35,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10020-astronomy-for-dogs/,2007-04-23T06:00:05,['The Aliens'],Astronomy for Dogs,"Three former members of the still underappreciated Beta Band recovene and revisit familiar psychedelic experiments, displaying impressive knowledge of pop's history but adding little to it themselves. The Beta Band were one of the most acclaimed Scottish bands of the late 1990s, bringing the bucolic to the iMac age. While their genre-agnostic indie-with-beats blew the minds of critics suffering from Oasis fatigue, it never quite caught on with the broader public, and by 2005 the group were no more. On Astronomy for Dogs, the Beta Band co-founder Gordon Anderson and former members Robin Jones and John Maclean revisit familiar psychedelic experiments, displaying impressive knowledge of pop's history but adding little to it themselves. Good as it is to have these dudes back, their reunion sounds disappointingly anticlimactic. The piano-splashed rock 'n' roll of upbeat first single ""The Happy Song"" indicates the guys are ""happy happy happy,"" but for an unapologetically stupid pop song it's damningly devoid of a decent hook-- let alone the stark beauty of the Kinks' ""Everybody's Gonna Be Happy"". Astronomy for Dogs opens with solo-spattered second single ""Setting Sun"", something like ""All Along the Watchtower"" with lyrics befitting the Chemical Brothers' homonymous 1996 single. What, too proud to call it a cover? The album is full of such moments where sonic reference trumps songwriting, a problem that also sometimes befalls other recent purveyors of record-collector rock like Band of Bees and the Earlies (if I mention Girl Talk I might get fired). The Aliens skip from the close Cyrkle harmonies and Del Shannon guitar arpeggios of plaintive kiss-off ""Tomorrow"" to join Midlake's 70s soft-rock revival on long-haired piano whimper ""Honest Again"". Token krautrock droner ""Only Waiting"" exhales India-scented melodies until tripping into a hyperactive ""I Am the Walrus""-meets-Psycho orchestral psyche-out. And so on. It's not that the Aliens are incapable of the pop fireworks that made the Beta Band a name classmates used to ask me about on their way back from High Fidelity. ""She Don't Love Me No More"" is a mild, string-enhanced take on towering Southern rock balladry, synth-laden ""Rox"" touches down for sidewalk-strutting funk, and kazoo-toting Merseybeat bouncer ""Glover"" intermittently morphs into a mean game of outer-space pinball. Still, even these songs sound more like imitations of past glory than new incarnations of the same pioneering spirit. The most ""Dry the Rain""-like track here, swooning anthem ""I Am the Unknown"", is perhaps illustrative of the Aliens' shortcomings. Picking up the weirdness of Anderson solo project Lone Pigeon, it's one of two songs on this album that end with the chanted reminder, ""We are the Aliens"". Two other songs shoot back, ""I am the Robot Man""-- and only one is future-funk breakdown ""Robot Man"".

36,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10021-dangerous-game/,2007-03-22T06:00:02,['Mary Weiss'],Dangerous Game,"The former Shangri-La's lead singer records her first album in decades, with help from Greg Cartwright and the rest of Reigning Sound. On Mary Weiss' homepage, there's a photo of her circa-1965 that looks straight out of 2007, right down to the tight, dark jeans tucked into brown knee-high leather boots. Even 40 years later, it's hard not to immediately crush out, especially staring into those kittenish saucer eyes. Does she want to cuddle you, crush you, or drink a pop? Weiss looks exactly how a mod, mid-60s girl-group frontchick, the leader of the charm school dropouts in the Shangri-La's, should look, an earth angel hiding cigarettes under princess beds and giving dad indigestion, stuffing all the roiling teenage sexual tension of the era into print dresses and pleated dress slacks. A few weeks back, Weiss performed on ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" in what had to be her first television appearance in decades, long sidelined by music industry nonsense. Backed live on the air, as on the new Dangerous Game, by Greg Cartwright's Reigning Sound, Weiss' time in civilian life was evident. While her voice was mostly in fine shape, she unsurprisingly appeared a little hesitant; the band was likewise hesitant, perhaps to give their idol a wide berth. Yet compare Weiss' slight awkwardness to the brassy showbiz bullshit of Diana Ross' recent appearance on ""American Idol"". Don't call it ""ordinariness""; instead, call it ""realness."" Realness is an odd word to invoke when discussing 60s girl groups, a very melodramatic world where everything was exaggerated for impact, and you especially shouldn't invoke it when Cartwright's writing for Dangerous Game pledges fidelity to the long-abandoned sound of the era. The music on Dangerous Game is gloriously authentic fakery, drawing more on Cartwright's deeply held classicism-- be it for blues, early rock 'n' roll, gospel, r&b, girl groups-- than the punk snarl of Reigning Sound records like Too Much Guitar. With just an organ in place of the massed strings, ""Break It One More Time"" has a Spectorian grandeur; it doesn't quite match the wall of sound, but it comes as close as a bar band can. So perhaps instead of realness, which really means nothing, Weiss is just being her old plain-spoken self. Cartwright's reproductions will thrill anyone with a slight interest in 60s rock; it's Weiss' unadorned and adult ruminations on love and loss, shoved through the pubescent syntax of the girl-groups, that give Dangerous Game its power. Even in the 60s, her bandmates sported bouffants like football helmets. Weiss wore her blonde hair down, the kind of sartorial choice that in pop music, where simple gestures mean just about everything, can communicate lofty stuff like a suspicion of artifice, a struggle with romanticism. The ""dangerous game"" we learn is love itself, of course, and from the first track, ""My Heart Is Beating"", Weiss is singing about someone who did her wrong, someone who cheated and lied. And yet she still wants them back, if they can just stick to the simple promise to straighten up and fly right. Even non-English speakers can probably surmise, just from Weiss' forlorn vocal, what exactly it was that got busted up on ""Break It One More Time"". The music may be time bound but the theme of Dangerous Game timeless: the struggle of a wounded heart that still wants to let its guard down enough to be loved. Its language isn't ""simple""-- even purposefully so, as you might think given how the music hearkens back to the simplicity of pre-Sgt. Pepper's rock; it's universal. The only time the album shows its limitations is on ""Cry About the Radio"", a hokey, albeit mercifully short, lament for the music Weiss grew up with. ""Kids don't know shit,"" she sings, more like a cranky old man than the tough-but-guarded lady she's been up until now. ""They just want a hit/ I don't write hits."" Except she did write hits at one point, and so of course, ""you may wonder where the real songs have gone,"" the kind of fogeyism we shouldn't accept from anyone, no matter how much of a legend they are. But still, from Cartwright's reverent licks to Weiss' surprisingly sturdy vocals, Dangerous Game is a small, self-contained triumph, an understated comeback that never tries to announce itself as an event. ""When I was a young girl/ You were my whole world,"" Weiss sings on the lovely ""Stitch in Time"", but she's not a young girl anymore, and the tension between her hard-earned knowingness and the sunny throwback simplicity of the music is what makes Dangerous Game great. Not making an album for decades may have been the best thing to happen to Weiss. There are no 80s comeback albums with gated Steve Lillywhite drums marring the discography; no trip-hop excursions in the mid-90s. She jumped straight from her classic material into a buoyant and yet mature second act. The Shangri-La's and other girl groups may have influenced legions of willfully infantile twee bands and hermetically sealed revivalists like the Pipettes, but here Weiss proves that the past shouldn't be a refuge. The power of those girl groups came from the steel reserve and starting sensitivity they had when facing the trials and tribulations of the present.",Mary Weiss: Dangerous Game Album Review | Pitchfork,7.6,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
37,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10022-from-here-we-go-sublime/,2007-03-26T06:00:01,['The Field'],From Here We Go Sublime,"Best new music Combining elements of the best ambient music with the emotive nostalgia and accessibility of Fennesz's Endless Summer and Boards of Canada, From Here We Go Sublime may wind up 2007's most luxuriant electronic record. After centuries of music consumption, we're still obsessed with the crescendo. From all that classical music we learned in school to modern soundtrack fodder to the banal quiet/loud/quiet dynamics of groups like Explosions in the Sky, people still seek the thrill that comes when music reaches its stirring Big Moment. Blame remote controls or the death of vinyl, but 30-odd years after Brian Eno invented ambient music, most people are wary about ""turning off"" to any music that doesn't actively seek to engage them. Deep listening remains mostly theoretical in the age of mp3s. Minimal techno isn't exactly built for the iPod age, so what's a post-disco producer to do when he wants the restraint but also the explosion? If most 21st century pop music could be whittled down to a ringtone without losing any of its effect, a dance producer who actually manages to hook the ear for six or seven minutes after that opening jolt-- while still rejecting, you know, narrative or harmonic development-- is doing something special. Axel Willner, founder and sole member of the Field, is hardly the first to split the difference, but his formally simple yet functionally overwhelming music captures not only those big ecstatic peaks but also the initial ringtone-esque bursts like the two sides of the same coin they are, and basically just repeats them until he decides to stop tape. Willner's records under his Field alias (his other guises include Cordouan, Lars Blek, and Porte) do away with the build-up almost entirely while still milking the climax like a chemist running real-time tests to see just how long he's got until the drug's effect wears off. That kind of pared-down sound-sculpting is everywhere in continental European electronic music these days, but rarely is it as instantly enveloping or as comforting as the Field's debut, From Here We Go Sublime. The album recalls Kaito, another artist on the German label with one great idea, likewise pushing wistfulness and simplicity to the brink. Favoring a dreamy minimalism of just a few sounds waltzing around each other, Willner smears, chops, and processes slivers of musical information-- the tips of a vocal, a note and a half of an instrumental-- in a delicate computer-assisted retrieval process. But unlike other maestros of hiccup and twang, Willner favors uncomplicated, revolving compositions rather than a loom-like mesh. It's a bare bones compositional gambit that could wind up utterly irritating, but with the ears of a hip-hop cratedigger and the hands of a surgeon is bliss. Gliding like zero-gravity skaters, opener ""Over the Ice"" spins, twirls, and pivots on just a shivering vocalized ""e""-- split across two octaves-- and an undulating ""i."" But if Sublime initially sounds set for the dancefloor and not the couch, it's strictly down to Willner favoring quick tempos and rhythms, like the concussive ""uh!"" and the bumping acid bassline on ""The Little Heart Beats So Fast"". Despite its nods to house and techno, Sublime is really an extension of the best ambient electronics of the last decade or so, especially Gas, a project of Wolfgang Voigt, who as co-owner of Kompakt Records is now releasing the Field's music. (Not for nothing did Willner's sublime ""Kappsta"" appear on Kompakt's Pop Ambient 2007 even as it could easily fit here.) Folks may also call the Field trance, because there's an often anthemic bigness to Willner's little sounds, a certain shameless bombastic quality to the way he deploys his loops and builds his arpeggios. And like both bog-standard dancefloor trance and ethereal Gas records such as Pop, Field tracks sound loud, even when played soft. People may also call it trance because of Willner's elementary drum tracks, often just a deflated machine thump flecked with hi-hat hiss. Compared to peers like Perlon, Kompakt may not be particularly known for its adventurous drum programming but Willner's purposefully entry-level beats shift much of the percussive burden onto his melodies. And while Willner may be building his arpeggios out of baby love sighs snatched from the mouths of the Temptations (on ""Things Keep Falling Down"", sadly not included here) or strummed guitar loops nicked from nuggets of yacht rock instead of preset synth pads or Ableton plug-ins, his spirit animals are the likes of Sasha, Digweed, and Tiesto, guiding him on how to put his sounds together for maximum spine-tingly impact. There's a reason those guys sold so many records to a whole generation of folks looking for, well, the sublime. And like all those 2xCD 1990s trance mixes, an hour of Willner's vibrations may have you drooling for an off-beat or a key change or, hell, a build-up to crescendo. But forget pop musical concerns for a second-- Willner's triumph on Sublime remains how he manages to isolate and repeat his little moments, transmuting them through the basic dance music building blocks of juxtaposition and repetition into something bigger, wringing pleasure out of the always potentially dull aforementioned ""sound sculpting"": The metallic schlurp of the drums and background hum of robot cicadas on ""Mobilia""; the fingertip flutters of the textural stuttering all over Sublime; the hot and heavy pressurized soaking of ""Sun and Ice""; the disembodied zombie doowop filched from the Flamingos' ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" that echoes through the title track like Kraftwerk daydreaming they're a soul duo, before the voices finally unspool into a timestretched blur as the record fades out-- one of the most shiver-inducing moments you'll hear all year. Often the best part of Willner's tracks are those final few seconds, as on ""A Paw in My Face"", the guitar sample finally escapes its loop with a joyous twang of freedom (only to reveal its source as Lionel Richie's bloodless lite-FM staple ""Hello""). If Willner doesn't hit at least some of your pleasure centers, well, forget your ears-- your nerve endings might actually be dead. Even three months in, it's a safe bet that From Here We Go Sublime will wind up 2007's most luxuriant record.",The Field: From Here We Go Sublime Album Review | Pitchfork,9.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
38,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10023-quixoticism/,2007-03-27T06:00:05,['Ghost Stories'],Quixoticism,"Former Joggers and Fruit Bats member offers wordily titled, soft-spoken guitar ditties that twist pop trends and the works of his folk forebears. Ron Lewis, aka Ghost Stories, is a folk-rock hybrid content to try every pleasure-seeking trick in the indie reference book. And it comes as no surprise to learn that the former member of the Fruit Bats and the Joggers' RIYL trip through 1990s indie rock was partially conceived seven years ago, making for several nostalgic, easygoing pieces content to sit on an era gone by. Lewis perfected the older tunes, wrote a few 00s trend-teasers, and recorded it all in the comfort of his home. Keeping acoustics at the helm, he uses feather-light production techniques and barely there vocals that will likely swaddle half his listeners in comatose joy and bore the rest. The airy falsetto and soft harmonies that Lewis curls around blogger favorite ""The Upper Ten/The Lower Five"" would fit in with the easy melodic beauty of Aimee Mann's vaguely mystical rockouts on Bachelor No. 2. This song's melodically predictable and limply performed intro is a prelude to a dithering, withering structure of lilting verse vs. messy chorus that lacks innovation and punch-- even for all its ambitious rhythmic alterations. There's something to be said for an imagination that can pull the acoustic guitar out of its apparent rut, but in the end it's the more modern sonic nods-- synths and other voracious electronics-- that will slightly exalt this album out of indie limbo. ""You Wear It Like a Stained Glass Window"" rips electric guitars through a noisy, melody-free intro, creating a better contrast than the previous track with a grating, static-drenched chorus and fumbling, quiet, and unplugged verses. Those dichotomous halves stay together because they're equally crushing, full of popular modern indie motifs such as cute keyboards, nonsensically cute vocals, obedient bass, and the occasional violence from the electric guitar. And it's often the instrumentation that impresses on this debut. The slow, rolling guitar strums that open ""The Motions"" and its heartbeat rhythm of drum and bass move the song beyond its simplistic, mostly word-free vocal smatterings. As the ditties get prettier-- bird-chirping ""Secret Life of the Union, Part I"" stands out-- the Elliott Smith vocal blandishes can be forgiven, even enjoyed (at the very least, ignored). But often the influences are too blatant and the songs too underdeveloped. De rigueur pop ballad ""Secret Life I"" is a strange departure, but a coloring that the album needs to just outweigh the derivative with the explorative.",Ghost Stories: Quixoticism Album Review | Pitchfork,6.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

So the idea for Poor Aim: Love Songs was to make a short record of radio-ready pop hits, at the time a new idea for the Blow. The first collaboration between Khaela Maricich (previously the only Blow member) and Jona Bechtolt (YACHT), they put it out in 2004 as the inaugural Pregnancy Series release, curated dually by Portland hometeamers States Rights Records and Slender Means Society, and had it reissued by K this year after commissioning remixes (from Lucky Dragons, Strategy, and Alan Fortarte of White Rainbow, among others) for most of the original tracks. Those few who copped a copy at the time likely found it easy to recognize big pieces of it on the Blow's 2006 full-length Paper Television. Each record features tricky couples math, naturalism-as-sex-and-love metaphors, YACHT's propulsive synthwork and Maricich's pointedly broken syntax: Maricich asked the boy on ""Hey Boy"" ""why you didn't call me?"" and told another lover ""You don't even believe in outer space/ Equal to the rate at which you doubt my crying face."" Some dude asks her to put her heart in his hand and even though she knows he might hock it she can't keep it in her pocket, so, oh man. The Blow beat accusations of exhibitionism and confessionalism the same way rappers do-- with specifics, and without being particularly sentimental. Rock 'n' roll, de-abstracted. When on ""The Sky Opened Wide Like the Tide"" she's wondering where her friends are tonight, her guesses are practical, a citywide Olympia, Wash., tour: ""Are they at the Reef? Are they at Ben Moore's? Are they at the Capitol Theater?"" By Paper Television, YACHT caught up, plundering commercial radio airwaves for regional rap crazes (snap music, hyphy, crunk, etc) and Timbalandesque gorgeous sound to put together the perfect palate for his partner's rapper sensibility. Poor Aim, for Bechtolt, was a more mixed bag-- ""Hey Boy"" came from J-Kwon's ""Tipsy"", a Billboard #2 that year, but most of his other original tracks stuck hard to the indie-dance friendly sped-up rave that the Blow are now notable for barely using. The hip-hopization of indie rock was (is) a long time coming. By commissioning the six new remixes here, the Blow admit their songs aren't perfect, could be different, or better, and that they're open to new ideas. It's a casual gesture, too-- no pretense of their art as island-- inviting friends and like-minded people to make new work from theirs. The newly remixed Poor Aim is reminiscent of other Portland documents (the States Rights Records Bro Zone compilation comes to mind), on which artists feature other artists guest on and remix one another's work, bringing a mixtape mindset to an arena where work usually has to be singular and hermetically complete just to be taken seriously. On ""The Love That I Crave"", Maricich sings, ""I'm so tired of being wasted just chasing the same old thing/ I want to get hit by a big thing, come take me, change me,"" which is as good an explanation of why they bothered to remix all this stuff as any. YACHT and Maricich both take the opportunity to do reworks of their own, one way they embrace the evolution of their group. YACHT's ""Hock It"" remix loops the track's catchphrase to give it a chorus-- important for those commercial aspirations-- and also update it: give his track more heft, more G-funk, more quirk. His new ""Hock It"" is less linear, more club-worthy. Los Angeles-based Lucky Dragons aka Luke Fishbeck is the one non-Portland remixer. But it was his sojourns in Portland and tours with Portland artists over the last four years that helped YACHT, E*Rock, Bobby Birdman, and co. create their DIY-laptop scene. His Blow remixes are the smartest-- turning ""The Sky Opened Wide"" back into the gypsy ballad that it was before the electronics got to it, all wistful violin, guitar, and recorder; then taking the ""we're over here"" samples from that same song and making a new one of his own to close the record: pitch-shifting computer flutes; floating voices; samples cut in and out and scrambled, gently. Strategy, a Portland-based remixer, LCDs-out ""The Love That I Crave"", glamming up the vocals and giving it a disco sheen, while Alan Fortarte takes ""Hey Boy"" to it's ""Tipsy""-limit, chopping up Maricich's ABCs. It'd be easy to say then that the upshot of Poor Aim: Love Songs, v. 2, is process-in-motion, or window-into-band-at-work, proof of evolution, etc but if that stuff exists here it's on the fringes.

40,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10025-person-pitch/,2007-03-22T06:00:01,['Panda Bear'],Person Pitch,"Best new music On his third solo outing as Panda Bear, Animal Collective's Noah Lennox balances blossoming melodic pop with wildly experimental sound techniques, hitting on a stunningly unique sound that's both overwhelming and inspirational. Inside the booklet included with Panda Bear's third solo album, Person Pitch, is a list of artists. The first four named are microhouse artists Basic Channel, Luomo, Dettinger, and Wolfgang Voigt. Maybe Noah Lennox, the man behind the Panda Bear, began this influence-naming exercise in a minimal techno state of mind. On the other hand, the inclusion of these four at the top could be significant. We always knew that the guys from his main band, Animal Collective, had an ear out for electronic music, but with Panda Bear, the impact of the DJ seems to run deeper. The music on Person Pitch soundsnothing like proper dance music, but the basic structure-- the use of dynamics, and above all, the sense of repetition-- draws heavily from that context. Which is particularly interesting considering what else is going on. The Beach Boys always come up when talking about Panda Bear, and not just because he shares their fondness for certain melodic turns: When he allows the reverb to blanch his voice, Lennox can sound uncannily like Brian Wilson. This tunefulness gives Person Pitch an appeal that extends beyond just Animal Collective fans, but the way the songs are put together also gives them an unusual twist. Producers in Brian Wilson's era never worked like this, sampling old songs and instruments and spinning them in wheels of sound that seem like they could go forever. Most of this record consists of intricately constructed, heavily layered, and highly repetitive loops on top of which Lennox sings oddly familiar and touching melodies. But despite its grounding in guitar pop, Person Pitch isn't likely to be mistaken for the work of a band. It sounds like what it is: one guy alone in his bedroom trolling through music history, picking and choosing bits to make something deeply personal and all his own. The repetition of the music here, though probably engendered by computer, has a strange analog quality. You can almost see the turntables rotating on the opening ""Comfy in Nautica"", which loops Lennox's sung ""ah""'s and handclaps to evoke ritual campfire music, while the deep reverb on his voice puts us in the same liturgical headspace found on his very different acoustic record Young Prayer from 2004. ""Take Pills"" repeats a tambourine and twangy guitar during its slower opening section while industrial samples that sound like car parts being followed down an assembly line fill in the vast spaces. The field recordings take an aquatic turn on the track's second half, as Lennox picks up his acoustic guitar and moves the party to the beach, singing ""I don't want for us to take pills anymore"" to the kind of effortlessly melodic line that once expressed thoughts like ""da doo ron ron."" Given the presence of such tremendously catchy pop moments on Person Pitch, the record's indulgences feel completely earned. The flurry of tabla that opens the extended ""Good Girl/Carrots"" sticks out at first but makes sense once Lennox gets the hectic dub chaos out of his system and settles into the second section's hypnotic tune. When the song edges become wispy and shapeless on ""I'm Not"", which blends Lennox's voice with an indistinct droning synth, the mood and thrust of the album gives the track the appropriate context. ""Search for Delicious"", reminiscent of the glowing ambient drift of Lennox's side project Jane, won't leave the drone alone, repeatedly knocking Lennox's singing off track like a clumsy but well-meaning drunk. Music of such warped processing would be a specialist's item, but as a breather here, before the simple and childlike music-box closer ""Ponytail"", it feels right. I still haven't talked about the 12-and-a-half-minute ""Bros"", the astonishing track that serves as the album's centerpiece. It's here that Person Pitch's repetition and DJ's sense of timing are most apparent, while Lennox's songwriting hits a melodic peak. The first few bars turn to the golden age of 60s and 70s radio, with some rattling percussion chipped from Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and a chiming acoustic guitar that could be pulled from the Beach Boys' ""Girl Don't Tell Me"". But as the loops pass on ""Bros"", the song begins to seem like a glorious travelogue, a journey along a path where all the music's influences are visible along the roadside: the Wilson Brothers in their pinstripe shirts, or the queasy phasing and random sound effects-- a subway, people on a roller coaster, a baby crying-- of Lee ""Scratch"" Perry. When Panda begins to chant halfway through, we hear an echo of his main band, and when the neo-Latin piano comes in during the latter portion, transforming the track from internally-focused meditation to outwardly-beaming celebration, we get an image of Derrick May's classic techno anthem ""Strings of Life"" busting into a DJ set to make everyone go crazy. Person Pitch as a whole-- and ""Bros"" in particular-- evokes the sunshine of Lennox's adopted Lisbon, Portugal home. But it's the kind of light best experienced with eyes closed-- with the rays filtered through eyelids, turning the world into various shades of red and orange. You can feel the warmth pouring out of the music and see abstractions of its inspirations-- that whole long list and more-- as they cycle around again and again and again. Five of these seven songs have been released in various forms on singles and 12""s previously, so the exceptionally high quality of this music isn't a surprise to those who have been following Panda Bear closely. Still, hearing it all together in one place and listening to it all at one time is both overwhelming and inspirational.",Panda Bear: Person Pitch Album Review | Pitchfork,9.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Thanks to cultural parodies like Crocodile Dundee and Outback Steakhouse, Americans might be forgiven for having a rather one-sided view of Australians, one that's eerily similar to the rest of the world's opinion of us: They're loud, boorish, and crass; they have ridiculous accents; their slang sounds infantile at best and outright scatological at worst. Before I get deluged with indecipherable hate mail from the other side of the world, note that these stereotypes are acknowledged as such, and since most Americans I know aren't morbidly obese warmongers who wear nothing but garish nylon wind-suits and kitschy embroidered sweaters, my intuition tells me that there must be many Australians who don't get drunk at noon and wallop each other with boomerangs for sport. The Australian electronic composer Victor Bermon is proof positive. Judging from the jazzy strains of Bermon's Hefty Records debut, he seems like an agreeable fellow-- bookish and contemplative, with an interest in the sublime, if not the rapturous. Arriving at Night contains some of the easiest-listening electronic music this side of the Album Leaf. It proceeds by an inflexible logic where pleasing tones flow by with frictionless grace: nothing more, nothing less. In the vein of Prefuse 73 and Four Tet, Bermon straddles the divide between ambient electronic music and glitchy instrumental hip-hop. But unlike his more adventurous peers, he has exactly one mode: serene. A mood of tranquility dominates every track, including the ones that make room for the boom and the bap amid their prismatic digital minutiae, liquid arpeggios, and humming strings. The glassy shuffle ""Farewell Lunch for Laura"" has more contrast than anything else on the record: Liquid strokes of guitar, staticky gurgles, soft horns, flecked pianos, ballooning bass, and surges of insistent percussion comprise, for Bermon, an unusually varied sound range with three distinct phases of emphasis. But his progressions are so orderly, his shifts so crisp and telegraphed, that even the album's dynamic peaks (see also ""Famous Discussion"" and ""Theatre of Signs"") tend to recede comfortably into the middle distance. ""Photographs Are Not Memories"", which cycles between a canter and a trot as guitars tangle in a haze of beatific timbre, is velvety-smooth even when a gnarled tone starts scratching through the background for texture. While the comparable Album Leaf seems to often get by on pretty alone, Bermon's compositions are more heady and sly. One intuits in him a keen eye for natural patterns and symmetries-- concentric ripples on a pond; the delicate vein structures of leaves-- that he's simply unwilling to disrupt when translating them into sound. Even his glitches, like the staccato lunges of ""View of the Islands"", betray a love of order-- Bermon's glitches slot neatly into one another to produce somnolent, buttoned-down cadences, and the tones sliding away from the mix seem locked into invisible curves. From the shivering waves of ""We Face Each Other"" to the sun-struck slush of ""Unprepared"" to the chime-laden haze of ""Stacked Notebooks"", you always know just what to expect from Victor Bermon-- some permutation of clatter, hitch, shuffle and glide, drenched in gentle reverb and melodious samples, repeated ad infinitum. That Arriving at Night still merits repeated listening speaks to the care that went into crafting these tracks, which demand very little from listeners in return for their pleasure.",Victor Bermon: Arriving at Night Album Review | Pitchfork,6.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Fucking Champs' Tim Green, who has produced records for the Melvins, Six Organs of Admittance, and Comets on Fire, is clearly a guy who understands the finer points of heavy, retrofitted psych-rock. And this professional expertise comes in particularly handy on Ekranoplan, the second album from Bay Area trio the Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound. Following their self-released 2005 debut, which was limited to 500 copies, the group here gives all the familiar old Blue Cheer/Floyd/Elevators touchstones another thunderous and sympathetic throttle. Under Green's watchful care, the Assemble Head reach an appropriate balance between the spontaneous intensity of a live gig and a well-curated studio session, performing their passionate, formalist rock maneuvers with an accompanying waft of patchouli and beer-soaked denim. Ekranoplan takes its name from an enormous, low-flying Soviet transport used to shuttle troops beneath enemy radar during the Cold War. And though you'd likely have to live on the Caspian Sea to know for certain, one might reasonably assume that these monsters were able to generate a truly hellacious roar. If so, the Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound have tagged their work accurately, as this album achieves a deafening lift-off right from its opening chords and sustains its noisy trajectory throughout the duration of these nine tracks. As with such groups as Comets on Fire or Dead Meadow, the individual elements of the Assemble Head's onslaught are less important than the music's overall cumulative wallop. Despite the frequent addition of Ray Castro's vintage keyboards and the occasional Technicolor flourish of acoustic guitar or theremin, the bulk of the album rests on the core trio of Jefferson Marshall, M.I.K.E. Lardas, and Charlie Saufley. These songs all put a hefty premium on sky-blasted guitar solos and distant, echo-laden vocals that can give the album the impression of having been recorded at the same type of wide-open, abandoned locations where Roger Corman and Herschell Gordon Lewis used to shoot biker movies. In such an environment, of course, the strength of each recurrent riff becomes vitally significant. Fortunately, the Assemble Head appear to have the necessary goods at ready supply, equipping the melodic ""Mosquito Lantern"" with a clever inversion of Floyd's ""Lucifer Sam"" riff, and plotting out the prog-inclined ""Occult Roots"" with a procession of dark, swirling arpeggios. Occasionally, as on the title track or the ferocious ""D Brown"", the group do put their cavernous solos before their songcraft, leaving the listener with the afterimage of a vague, generalized din rather than a specific chorus or melody. More impressive, however, are such predominantly instrumental tracks as the majestic ""A Bourbon For Rudy"" or the acoustic-based ""The Morning Maiden"" (which has been listed elsewhere as ""The Chocolate Maiden""). On these tracks the Assemble Head take a considerably more thoughtful approach to song structure, raising their roofbeams gradually before giving way to their more florid, hippified outbursts. From the vantage of these peaks it is easy to imagine the Assemble Head eventually moving their sound outward into a more progressive direction, one where they are perhaps a little less inclined to settle for their affectionate browsing through the stoner rock archives.",The Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound: Ekranoplan Album Review | Pitchfork,6.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
43,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10028-now-its-time/,2007-03-28T06:00:05,['Paula Frazer and Tarnation'],Now It's Time,"Despite the double billing-- the band name Tarnation graces a CD spine for the first time in more than a decade-- this album feels like a solo record rather than that 90s group's riotous alt-country. Despite the fact that the name Tarnation hasn't graced a CD spine in more than a decade, this isn't really a reunion. For one thing, Tarnation were primarily a vehicle for Georgia-born, San Francisco-based Paula Frazer, who migrated to art-country after the dissolution of her Bay Area punk outfit Frightwig disbanded in 1992. Furthermore, besides Frazer, no one from any of Tarnation's previous albums plays on Now It's Time. In fact, several of these performers backed her on her last solo album, Leave the Sad Things Behind-- particularly multi-instrumentalist Patrick Main, Frazier's primary collaborator. It's more than just semantic, though. Now It's Time doesn't sound like a Tarnation reunion for the simple reason that this band doesn't sound like Tarnation. On Gentle Creatures in 1995 and Mirador in 1997, Frazer and her coterie of alternating Tarnaters made an unholy racket in the reverently quiet halls of alt-country, drenching spaghetti western guitars and high-lonesome vocals in canyon reverb-- more Morricone than Parsons or Cash. So Now It's Time is just another Frazer solo album. Nothing wrong with that, except that it makes the album's double billing seem particularly redundant. Over the course of a decade and two solo albums, the old weirdness streaking through the 90s Tarnation albums-- which essentially made eerie atmosphere a punk pursuit-- has gradually ossified into a gentler, less remarkable listening experience: The punk element has all but disappeared, leaving only easy atmosphere. The music on Now It's Time is minimal and restrained, occasionally striking but mostly polite and tasteful. The songs have their distinguishing musical characteristics-- piano on ""Bitter Rose"", dulcimer on ""Shadows""-- but they all strike the same vaguely mournful note and so tend to blur together. Things finally come together on the title track, which is drenched in welcome reverb and shows Frazer testing the limits of her voice, pushing its range so that it strains on the high notes. That's the only time when the lyrics and melody truly challenge the singer, but that's the second-to-last track on the album, so she cannot build on the moment. For many, Frazer's voice is the main draw to any of her albums, whether they bear her own name or Tarnation's. Her puncturing twang has softened over the year, but she remains as nimble as ever. Like the bird pictured on the album cover, she flutters in her upper register, light and lonesome, especially on ""First Sign"" and ""Another Day"". When she sings low, her voice becomes sharp and testy-- an interested contrast that she never pursues satisfactorily. With no strong songs to give it shape and no compelling music to give it purpose, Frazer's vocals sound lovely but a little distant, which is the curse of the album itself. Now It's Time is easy on the ears, but hard on the memory.",Paula Frazer and Tarnation: Now It's Time Album Review | Pitchfork,4.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They don't make many bands like Pretty Girls Make Graves anymore. The Seattle quintet probably stopped being cool in a trendy sense around the time I got turned onto them, a bit after 2003's The New Romance. As great as that record was, it showed a band mellowing and growing up in a way that made their frantic 2002 debut, Good Health, sound even better. Third album Elan Vital was even more mature, and now, this June, one of indie rock's best-named groups is set to break up. And I think I'm starting to go bald. Pretty fucking depressing. But still not as depressing as all the limp indie pop copyists filling the Pitchfork mailbox. Good thing there's Montreal trio Land of Talk to keep rocking out in PGMG's harried post-hardcore idiom. Frontwoman Elizabeth Powell's smoldering, harmonically complex fretwork and assured vocals help distinguish Land of Talk from the multi-layered massiveness of their city's best-known indie collectives. Instead, think Toronto's Tokyo Police Club with less treble and no handclaps, the Strokes, or sci-fi. Originally released in Canada last year, Land of Talk's blogger-beloved debut mini-album should finally hit U.S. stores like an unseasonably hot North wind. While the Applause Cheer Boo Hiss EP is a muscular record with gut-level riffs and fist-pumping choruses, it gets there anything but directly; you know you like it long before you know why. See, it's tough to know what Powell's saying half the time, and her guitar-playing overloads on melody so that it ends up communicating mostly mood-- in a year without Marnie Stern and Charlotte Hatherley, her chops might've been the story. The rest of the band stands out most clearly when the songs downshift from urgent release to tense restraint: drummer Bucky Wheaton's portentous cymbal falls and bassist Chris McCarron's undulating groove on finale ""Street Wheels"", for example. More often, Land of Talk storm ahead with the night at their heels, escaping lethargic beginnings on ""Sea Foam"" and getting buffeted by wind sound effects on ""Breaxxbaxx"". Somehow Powell finds a way to balance early Cat Power fragility and PJ Harvey volatility; whether mumbling indecipherably or singing about ""fuckin' around,"" girls who ""still piss their pants,"" or the dangers of drinking when already tired, she's always in command. Hard to believe she used to sing in a whispery pop group called Ele_K*. Then again, if Alanis Morissette taught us anything, it's that Canada is a land of reinvention.

45,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10030-visqueen/,2007-03-28T06:00:04,['Unsane'],Visqueen,"NYC post-hardcore band releases its first album since moving from Relapse to Mike Patton's Ipecac. The change doesn't signal a new direction, however, as the group remains rooted in tightly wound punk-metal. When Relapse released the Unsane retrospective Lambhouse in 2003, it seemed like a fitting end to a succinct, consistent career (the group's last proper album being 1998's Occupational Hazard). But apparently the band saw it as a beginning, reforming shortly after and releasing Blood Run in 2005. Taut and competent, the album didn't stain the Unsane legacy, but it didn't add anything either. And it certainly didn't disprove the theory that Lambhouse worked best as a tombstone. The same goes for Visqueen, Unsane's first album for Mike Patton's Ipecac label. The trio's patented sound-- tightly wound punk-metal featuring slashing guitars, muscle-bound rhythms, and the throat-stripping screams of Chris Spencer-- remains intact, albeit in slicker form. The problem is that this style holds no surprises 18 years after Unsane first coined it. And the band seems uninterested in pushing its songwriting forward, sticking to familiar patterns that are well executed but wholly predictable. This doesn't mean the dense guitar bombs of ""Last Man Standing"", the stair-climbing throb of ""This Stops at the River"", or the strident roar of ""Only Pain"" aren't entertaining. When not struggling too hard to compensate for mediocre tunes, Spencer's howls are compelling, and his slicing guitar cuts through nicely. Even Visqueen's goofier moments, like the straining ""Windshield"" (whose guitar line is oddly reminiscent of the Cars' ""Moving in Stereo""), work in isolated doses. But as a whole Visqueen collapses under the weight of its own immobility. A few tracks in, everything blends into a vague blur: Spencer's cadences repeat, Vinny Signorelli's drumbeats get cloned, and Dave Curran's bass fuzz bleeds across songs. Maybe it's just album-length fatigue that makes later cuts like the lethargic ""Line on the Wall"" and the middling-tempo ""Disdain"" sound so exhausted, but it's difficult to imagine any context in which they would exhilarate. Unsane throws its first curve on the final track, ""East Broadway"", an eight-minute grinder that strips things down to a vocal-less, minimalist pulse. But even that track outlasts its own inspiration, looping out into a bored, empty denouement. For the Unsane fanatic uninterested in variations on the band's well-worn theme, the album won't disappoint, and there's no shame in wanting more of the same. But there are enough interesting updates and original takes on this kind of sound out there that Visqueen can be recommended only to diehards, if at all.",Unsane: Visqueen Album Review | Pitchfork,5.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

When rumors circulated in 2002 that Earth, the legendary Seattle drone-metal group, was re-emerging after a long hiatus, a legion of followers was duly stoked. Though the band's resonating torch had been carried forward by groups such as Sleep and Sunn0))), to diehards only Dylan Carlson held the master key to the eternal metal chord. The anticipation was rewarded: Following a few releases hinting at new directions, 2005's Hex, or Printing in the Infernal Method was a true rebirth. Filled with lonesome tunes built around Carlson's clean, twangy guitar, the album painted pictures of windy ghost towns and moon-lit deserts, and owed as much to post-rock and country as metal and drone. Many songs evoked the cinematic instrumentals of Slint or Mogwai, but with Carlson's gift for Zen-like patience. No crescendos, flourishes, or denouements: Just simple guitar marching towards an infinite horizon. Hibernaculum is Earth's first release since then, but it's not a follow-up as much as a history lesson told through the prism of Hex. It includes a four-track CD with three old Earth tunes redone in the Hex style, and a DVD documenting the band's post-Hex European tour. Musically, it might not quite match its predecessor, but as an updated retelling of the Earth tale, Hibernaculum is fascinating. The first two cuts on the CD are the most interesting. ""Ouroboros Is Broken"" began life as an 18-minute track on Earth's 1991 debut Extra-Capsular Extraction, a post-Sabbath growler full of fuzzy chords and machine-like drumbeats. Hibernaculum's eight-minute version is slower and dreamier, with Carlson's ""canyon bends"" shadowed nicely by the shuddering bass of Don McGreevy and quaking Korg of Sunn0)))'s Greg Anderson. Track two takes on ""Coda Maestoso in F (Flat) Minor"", a catchy rocker from Earth's 1996 ""pop"" album Pentastar: In the Style of Demons. Slowed to a glacial pace, the song becomes a desert mirage, turning each corner a few steps later than expected. Temporal illusion has long been a Carlson specialty, and here his frozen guitar web seems to hang in the air, eventually shining with the dewy gleam of Steve Moore's ringing piano. Throughout, Earth refuses to build to a climax or speed to a rush, wisely trusting that patience will be its own reward. A similar minimalism marks Seldon Hunt's Within the Drone, a tour documentary shot last spring. Mixing Carlson's subdued musings with hypnotic live footage, the film never hurries or jumps, allowing Earth's music to speak for itself. Particularly clever is Hunt's choice to cut to different performances of the same song, making the tour feel like one long composition. Carlson's bites offer a few nice revelations-- an obsession with LaMonte Young, an abandoned follow-up to Pentastar that would've included horn and string sections-- but his best lines are as simple as his best songs. ""If you're gonna do slow and simple,"" he says in his wizened stoner drawl.

And she'll sing about her problems, but she won't give a shit what you think of them. If this makes Winehouse read a little like Lily Allen, that's not far off the mark. Both are larger-than-life singers who've found perfect vehicles for their outsized personalities. In Allen's case, it's a cocktail of pop, reggae, and hip-hop, with a cigarette in hand; for Winehouse, it's soul, jazz, and blues with a bottle of booze. Both pay tribute to their influences, with Winehouse's lyrics featuring shout-outs to Ray Charles, Donny Hathaway, and Slick Rick, and the two even share a producer: Mark Ronson, who's also worked with everyone from Sean Paul and Macy Gray to Ghostface and Rhymefest. But Winehouse is anything but a Lily Allen doppelgänger. After all, soul and jazz music are typically considered the province of grownups, and while Winehouse could be accused of slipping on these styles like costumes, she imbues her music with a surprisingly genuine soulfulness. Ronson's sneaky production provides most of the album's wit: The old school backdrop to ""Me & Mr. Jones"" is especially winking against couplets like ""What kind of fuckery is this? You made me miss the Slick Rick gig."" But Winehouse's zingers (in that same song she tells her subject ""'side from Sammy you're my best black Jew"") and profane interjections (the title track begins ""He left no time to regret/ Kept his dick wet"") are only an occasional thing as she travels a well-worn lyrical path to both clinical and romantic rehabilitation. Songs like ""Love Is a Losing Game"" are full of regret, even if Winehouse refuses to wallow entirely in self-pity. However, as one might expect following the declaration of ""Rehab"", Winehouse does spend much of Back to Black on the defensive, trying to explain why she's stayed with the same guy who's done her wrong, or, in the case of ""Wake Up Alone"", why her ex gives her the night sweats (""I drip for him tonight,"" Winehouse less delicately puts it). It's one of the eternal themes of soul music, here spiced up with post-modern production where less forceful personalities might have gone with strictly retro emulation. The references to girl groups, northern soul, and ska are there, but no one would confuse these approximations (split evenly between Ronson and Salaam Remi, who produced Winehouse's since-disowned debut) with the real thing. Fortunately, Winehouse has been blessed by a brassy voice that can transform even mundane sentiments into powerful statements. She may be heartbroken, but she uses that ache, twisting the emotional scars to suit her songs-- and if she often seems like the masochistic recipient of each knife twist, so be it. It's not until the album's final track, ""He Can Only Hold Her"", that Winehouse finally switches from first person to third, the ""I""s and ""me""s giving way to ""he""s and ""she""s, suggesting that she's finally become an objective observer, able to see her personal issues for what they are. ""He tries to pacify her, 'cause what's inside never dies,"" she sings, and we can only assume from this new vantage that Winehouse has moved on.",Amy Winehouse: Back to Black Album Review | Pitchfork,6.4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

""I am the future teller, I am the fortune teller, I am the scientist, I am the miracle man and I'm living here because I don't have anywhere else to live at the moment, but I'm not coming from here. My real name is Rain: a man with no fear, a man who do everything he desire without any law."" So reads the introduction to The Upsetter Selection. So far, so Lee Perry, then... All the same, it's just as well to admit that we'd be lost without the cosmic-travelling, lunatic-savant schtick. By now most of the stories surrounding this man-- burning his own Black Ark Studios to the ground, talking to palm trees, walking backwards through Kingston hitting the ground with a hammer, claiming to run the International Monetary Fund-- are as well loved as they are known. They're part of his appeal, as key to his legendary status as the music he makes. Keep an eye out for smoke and mirrors, though. View it from another angle and you can see that he's playing to the crowd-- fucking with us because we like it-- and you may even notice that that a kernel of truth lies nested at the heart of many of his eccentrically expressed statements, too. If nothing else, Perry's right about his bravery and disregard for convention; he's spent the past four decades almost single-handedly writing, rewriting, and occasionally shredding reggae's rulebook. Be it his collaborations with Clement ""Coxsone"" Dodd at Studio One, his stint with Joe Gibbs, his chart-topping songs with the Upsetters, his work with vocal artists including Bob Marley, U-Roy, and Junior Byles, or the alternate realities conjured by his dubs, it's safe to say that even the most casual music fan will have encountered his work at some point in their lives. Claiming an irrefutable place among Jamaica's foremost musical innovators, Perry has already been the subject of countless anthologies, box sets, primers, and cash-ins. Here, however, as part of Trojan Records' ongoing series of celebrity curated anniversary compilations, he gets to select himself. It's a riveting 2xCD journey, documenting most every stage of the producer's career. Especially notable are initial experiments such as dropping jagged squalls of baby screams into ""People Funny Boy"" and reversing the vocal of Burt Walters' ""Honey Love"", then releasing it as a whole new Upsetters' record, entitled ""Evol Yenoh"". Straightforward, a bit bonkers, and crying out to be done, these tricks went on to become trademarks that are now immediately recognized around the world-- the things that made his name. But why stay rooted on the earthly plane? Fast forward and you'll find Perry crediting himself as the man who helped Bob Marley vanquish the dark spirits that were at the time preventing his success. Listening to the languid defiance in the singer's voice on 1970's ""Duppy Conqueror"", it's an easy claim to believe. Regardless of the metaphysical or supernatural, Perry's relationship with the Wailers continued for many years, the collaboration's finest few minutes represented by ""Small Axe"", a song Marley never bettered. Disc Two, meanwhile, ups the interest right from the start, kicking off with a triptych of ""skank"" tunes-- Charlie Ace & Lee Perry's ""Cow Thief Skank"" and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry & the Upsetters' ""Bathroom Skank"" and ""Kentucky Skank"". Almost confrontationally experimental for their time, these cuts remain mind-blowing. Packed with torrential collages of effects, they're perfect examples of the studio-as-instrument approach to production. Perry wrenches everything he can out of the mixing desk, then throws yet more at it, creating cavernous percussion rolls and splattering them with the greasy crackles of frying chicken or bursts of lascivious bump and grind. The result is disorienting, weird and extraordinarily seductive. Reach just far enough and ""Cow Thief""'s bricolage of several different songs, recorded in 1973, can even be seen as a precursor to electronic music's sampling and hip-hop's re-contextualization of the breakbeat. Still, all highfalutin ideas fly out of the window when you learn that the record's sole point was to take the piss out of fellow sound man Niney the Observer's shoes. While capable of extreme oddness (both personal and sonic), Perry has always had a natural gift for working with singers. His skill is unmistakable on Jah Lion's ""The Lama (aka The Spiritual Whip)"", Prince Jazzbo's ""Penny Reel"", and Max Romeo's ""Fire Fe the Vatican"", but nowhere is it better displayed than on Susan Cadogan's ""Hurt So Good"", still one of the sexiest pieces of music ever committed to wax. Moving on through 1983's ""I Am a Madman"" to the title track of 2003's Grammy-winning reggae album Jamaican E.T., it becomes evident that we'll probably never know the real Lee Perry, how sane he is, whether he really believes the things he says. It's not important, either, because, as great a creation as his persona may be, his music is infinitely better.",Various Artists: The Upsetter Selection-- A Lee Perry Jukebox Album Review | Pitchfork,8.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
49,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10034-waitin-to-inhale/,2007-03-29T06:00:02,['Devin the Dude'],Waitin' to Inhale,"The fourth solo album from this Houston rapper and perennial underdog is both his most beautiful and most disturbing to date. About two thirds of the way through Waitin' to Inhale, the fourth solo album from Houston rapper and perennial underdog Devin the Dude, there's a deeply troubling and perplexing song called ""Just Because"". Lyrically, ""Just Because"" isn't far from Eminem's deranged wife-murder fantasy ""Kim""; Devin raps to an ex-lover about all the various ways he wants to humiliate, torture, or kill her. Musically, though, it couldn't be further from Eminem's ominous crashes. Instead, it's a weird parody of dentists'-office adult-contempo, with sterile Kenny G sax-runs and glistening Richard Marx pianos. Devin raps all his graphic revenge scenarios in a sort of stoned mumble, something akin to the sensitive-thug coo LL Cool J used on ""I Need Love"": ""Get a hotel suite 20 stories above/ And chuck you out the window, watch you fly like a dove."" It's a hate song disguised as a love song, and that thin joke doesn't make it any more defensible. And yet I still want to give Devin the benefit of the doubt. Over his three uniformly great previous albums, Devin has crafted one of the most likeable personas in rap, an unremittingly decent and dependably funny everyloser, rapping about his broken-down vintage Cadillac and his struggles to pay his bills with a soothingly melodic drawl and a wicked instinct for self-deprecation. Devin croons his crass pickup lines over fluttery beds of warm, organic tracks that balance their heavy, shuddering 808s with pianos and flutes and acoustic guitars. The euphorically laid-back funk has a way of dissipating into the air, allowing Devin's sly jokes and forthright introspection to sneak up on you. Devin's no stranger to nasty sex-raps, but more often than not he's the butt of his own jokes or the hapless victim of his drawn-out story-songs. And even at his most reprehensible, he's been shockingly free of venom. He draws more from ribald storyteller comedians like Richard Pryor and Rudy Ray Moore than from any rapper, and it's hard to stay offended when he plainly refuses to take himself seriously. But on Waitin' to Inhale, the punchlines come a lot less frequently, and so do his comeuppances. On older records, he might've let loose with a line like this one, from album opener ""She Want That Money"": ""Bitch, you crazy; go wipe that cum out your nose/ Cuz you nothing but a money-hungry crumb-snatching ho""-- but he would've ended the song lying in a puddle of his own blood after the girl's brother paid him a visit. Now the other shoe never quite drops, and sometimes it should: On ""Cutcha Up"", he raps about wanting to fuck an underage girl. ""Hope I Don't Get Sick-A-This"" is a rough-sex memoir, something that would sound a whole lot natural coming from Lil Wayne or 8Ball or Redman. Those guys all have tough, commanding vocal presences; Devin delivers his lyrics in a calm, reasonable tone that somehow makes all his talk that much more disturbing. On the evidence of a few later tracks, Waitin' to Inhale could be Devin's breakup album. ""No Longer Needed Here"" is a just-got-dumped lament, bitter but nuanced: ""Go find that fountain of youth, that fantasy life/ Where you don't have to work on it to make it right."" On ""Don't Wanna Be Alone"", Devin eschews rapping for singing, crooning needy girl-don't-leave-me stuff. Right next to each other, those two songs would add up to a powerful picture of romantic desperation, but ""Just Because"" comes right in between them and seriously compromises the effects of both. So maybe Devin is turning his personal anguish into angry music; he certainly wouldn't be the first. I'd prefer to think that his songs are more about misogyny than reflections of it. Devin's an avowed fan of 70s soft-rock, particularly James Taylor, and that guy certainly didn't blanch at portraying himself as an enormous asshole. Maybe Waitin' to Inhale finds John Updike's influence finally trickling down to Houston rap via Taylor, a development almost as potentially interesting as Lil Wayne's current sentimental-absurdist Kurt Vonnegut phase. But maybe I'm squirming around for excuses for Devin because I like him so much, so consider my recommendation to be a vote of confidence, but be prepared to get potentially grossed out if you delve into this album. The number at the top of this page reflects a couple of other things, too: For one, this album is as musically pretty as anything Devin's ever done. The album unfolds as a beautiful whole, its miasmic funk relaxing into itself, never pushing too hard but never fading into the background completely either. And Devin still shows occasional evidence of the self-mocking spark he's always had; ""She Useta Be"" is a light, mellow track about a chance encounter with a girl who rejected him in high school: ""A hundred and fifty pounds and ten years later/ Seen her at the grocery store; she tried to holler at a playa."" But the record's delirious peaks come when Devin leaves his own sexual frustration behind completely. ""What a Job"" is a warm and trenchant look at the absurdities in the career of a rapper, and it boasts the best Andre 3000 verse in years. And ""Lil' Girl Gone"" is a melodramatic lost-innocence number way prettier and more powerful than Ludacris's similarly themed ""Runaway Love"". Its weeping strings, cascading pianos and on-fire guest-verses by Lil Wayne and Bun B give the track a widescreen grandeur that the rest of the album coolly avoids, and its simple decency goes a long way toward making up for Devin's sins on the rest of the album.

Vieux Farka Touré's debut album is a transitional work, representing the passing of a standard from a father to a son. Some of Malian guitar legend Ali Farka Touré's final recordings are here on his son's debut, which takes the signature desert guitar style of Ali and subtly builds on it. It's difficult for a young musician to step out from the shadow a parent so revered in the same field, but to his credit Vieux is content to move slowly and find his own approach to the style. Vieux and Ali play together on two tracks, and their interaction-- the son plays rhythm guitar and gives his father's unmistakable leads free reign, with interjections from ngoni player Bassekou Kouyaté-- is not surprisingly marked by deference and respect. ""Tabara"" is a slow and meditative instrumental spotlighted by a mellifluous lead from Ali, into which Vieux perfectly slips his minimal backing rhythm. The other collaboration, ""Diallo"", is a conversation between Vieux's wizened, parched vocals and Ali's electric guitar, which carries his distinctive pinched tone. The rhythm is propelled by hand percussion, which is this case means sound actually created by the hands, without drums or blocks. As if to draw a line in the Saharan sand between father and son, ""Tabara"" is immediately followed on the record by ""Ana"", a song that unites Mali and Jamaica, bringing desert guitar to the funky upstroke of reggae. At first, it feels like a minor excursion, but then the horns and bassline hit and drive the groove home all the way for a stunningly effective synthesis of the humid and the arid. ""Courage"" features an even more thrilling fusion, beginning in a sort of desert modal jazz fashion, with an acoustic guitar part that recalls the bassline of Miles Davis' ""So What"", but jumping into a straight-ahead rock groove a minute and a half in. Guest vocalist Issa Sory Bamba lets loose a crazed melismatic wail worthy of the most full-throated muezzin, and later harmonizes with album co-producer Eric Herman while Hassey Sarré's violin-like njarka lets loose fluttering phrases that sound a bit like backwards guitars. At the other end of the spectrum lie Touré's two instrumental duets with another elder statesman of Malian music, kora virtuoso Toumani Diabaté. ""Touré de Niafunké"" and ""Diabaté"", both tributes to the respective families of the men, display a deeply subliminal connection between the musicians. Diabaté's kora playing is delicate and precise, his glissandos traversing Touré's rich guitar lines as if held to them by gravity. The two close the album with nine minutes of slowly churning mind-meld that shivers with intensity. Touré dedicates the whole album to the memory of his father, who clearly is the single greatest influence present here. Listening, though, it's obvious that the younger Touré is itching to move on, experiment, and build something new of his own. He's not far from something truly progressive on his debut, and there are moments where he blows down barriers with frightening ease. His father's legacy may loom large, but Vieux Farka Touré stands well on his own.",Vieux Farka Touré: Vieux Farka Touré Album Review | Pitchfork,7.5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Since severing their romantic (and creative) partnership in 2001, Royal Trux's Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema seem to have swapped artistic trajectories. On Trux classics like 1992's self-titled skull-and-bones album and 1993's Cats and Dogs, it was Hagerty who played the straight-man role, offsetting Herrema's abrasive elocution and leavening the band's sometimes-inscrutable avant-blues bricolage with soul-baring acoustic serenades (""Junkie Nurse"") and meaty FM-radio-ready riffs. But where Hagerty's recent Howling Hex releases find him reverting to the lo-fi, found-sound-fuckery of Royal Trux's earliest releases, Herrema's new band RTX picks up where latter-day Trux tracks like ""Waterpark"" left off-- i.e., sandwiched between Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe on a 1981 Monsters of Rock bill. Coming from an artist who'd spent over a decade revitalizing classic rock clichés in alien contexts, the straight-up denim-and-leather posturing of RTX's 2004 debut Transmaniacon felt like an all too predictable progression (or rather regression), and the fact that it featured some rewrites of old Trux songs (""Shockwave Rider"" became ""Joint Chief"", ""Fear Strikes Out"" begat ""PB+J"") carried the implication that Herrema was struggling for inspiration in the absence of her long-time foil. However, with its opening title track, Western Xterminator suggests a promising return to the Trux tradition of album-to-album aesthetic 180s-- instead of the expected high-voltage guitar squeals we get an immersing, opium-den torch song guided along slowly by bongos and flute flourishes, Herrema investing its French-folk-song melody with a fading diva's empty-ashtray regret. But if this introduction presents a retreat from the heavy metal parking lot, the rest of Western Xterminator returns to the usual spot and sets up a permanent trailer-home in it, with the 70s-Stones sleaze of Herrema's former band all but vanquished for a full-on 80s headbanger's ball pitched halfway between Sunset Strip flash and New Wave of British Heavy Metal thrash. Good thing, then, that Herrema not only has the hair for the job, but the voice too-- stripped of the Trux's heroin haze, she can pretty much pass for Stephen Pearcy from Ratt (which could be why she rewrote ""Round and Round"" and called it ""Last Ride""). Guitarist Jaimo Welch is her de facto Hagerty, though his playing is less informed by Ornette Coleman's theory of harmolodics than the Eddie Van Halen theory of widdly-widdly-widdly. He'd rather impress the burnouts sitting in the back rows of the L.A. Forum than the editors of The Wire, and more power to him: In the foot-stomp crunch of ""Balls to Pass"" you'll find all the good riffs missing from the last Darkness album, and with ""Wo-Wo Din"" he makes a convincing argument that Sabbath's greatest moment wasn't ""Sweat Leaf"", but ""Symptom of the Universe."" RTX are well-positioned to court an indie-rock populace that's become ever more comfortable embracing its inner hesher, but Western Xterminator's production is just obtuse enough-- less arena rock than a transistor-radioed memory of arena rock-- to keep the band at a distance from the unironic mulletheads who'd probably dig their music the most. After all, you don't write a song like ""Restoration Sleep""-- with its ""Pour Some Sugar on Me""-styled brass-rail boogie and engagingly stoopid ""feels good!"" chorus-- unless you're aiming squarely for the Camaro crowd. RTX's brand of populist fist-pump metal benefits from this sort of direct delivery, but more often than not, Herrema lets her voice recede into the effects-pedaled riffs, rendering what should be the songs' focal point into a background sonic detail. ""Knightmare and Mane"", in particular, feels like a missed opportunity for a killer power ballad, as Herrema's phased-out vocals are too incomprehensible to elicit the raised lighters that its melancholic, grungy grind seems to warrant. Herrema hasn't always needed special effects to give her voice presence-- check the more heartfelt performances on the Trux's 1995 album Thank You, like ""(Have You Met) Horror James?""-- but her reliance on superfluous studio trickery all but guarantees that Western Xterminator's airplay will be confined to college-radio when, with a more refined presentation, it could be blasting from the Z-Rock 101s of the nation. The latter scenario, of course, is contingent on Drag City blowing all its Joanna Newsom profits on a radio promoter, but it'd be nice if RTX could give us a chance to dream.",RTX: Western Xterminator Album Review | Pitchfork,6.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Since upper Norway in early February remains dark both at night and during most of the day, it is impossible for a visitor with only three days in the country to assess time with any accuracy. Add alcohol, plus sleep deprivation to the already extant sensory deprivation, and the task becomes laughable. The vague occasion was the after-party to what had previously seemed the after-party, on the day after the last night of Trondheim's by:Larm festival, and thus it could have been nearly any time in the early or even late morning that we emerged out of cluster of warehouses and, ducking the wind off the snow and the nearby fjord, ascended the steps up into the third or fifth venue of the evening. Though we had been told otherwise, we did not expect the ""biker bar"" to which we had been referred to contain American-style bikers, to boast mounted Death Valley cow skulls and wall-to-wall worn-out leather jackets. And we did not expect the Moving Oos, which we knew as a side-project to the New Violators and were our last stop before the airport, to have much to do with ""classic rock""-- somewhere, somebody sketchily said, between the Faces and MC5. We expected them to sound like the New Violators: gauzy not bluesy, early 1980s not early 70s, good clothes and a dignified affect, not blue jeans and jean jackets. OK, that's not quite right. We knew their singer had worked as a truck driver and knew that Per Borten, the gifted music mimic, singer, and songwriter behind New Violators, wrote the Moving Oos' songs too. And we knew that the New Violators' occasional backup singer/siren was one of the two ""oos"" in that band's three-person vocal front (the two bands also share a drummer and keyboardist). Two of us had even seen the Oos the night before. But who could believe the same people carrying off such a brilliant American/English 80s pop resurrection could be doing the same thing later that evening for a completely different decade, the 1970s?? Anybody who's heard Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones or the Black Crowes or AC/DC-- everybody-- will know what's coming in this music minutes before it actually happens, making Peace and Love a brain-teaser of a good record. How can we still enjoy this stuff: the bluesy lick, guitar or keys; the tambourine hits on the eights; the gesture skyward cued by women saying ""ooh""; the multi-tracked, song-title-based chorus? The motorcycle revs on ""Natural Man"", the ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" interpolation on ""Turn Back Time"", the ""Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution"" intro on not one but two songs, ""Prisoner"" and ""Promised Land""? One answer is that Peace and Love is less homage than pretty close to the real thing, right place/wrong time, maybe, but right songs. What makes Peace and Love more than a joke or side-project or late night drunken escapism is something perhaps old fashioned or unfashionable, but it has to do with everyone in the band knowing how to sing, how to play their instruments, everyone knowing the exact moment on ""Romancer"" to get out of the way and let the two women deliver the second chorus by themselves, a shivery and sharp moment of clarity that says, just maybe, these guys know what they're about. It's easy to be taken by bands you see this way-- foreign place, foreign time, perfect for the exact moment they're stepping out into-- but the Moving Oos have no trouble pulling that space up by themselves, without help.

Everything gets slicker. When it comes to consumer technology, you just have to throw up your hands at some point. My discman finally died its death a month or so back, and I was forced to buy an iPod I couldn't really afford. If I'm honest, I caved mostly because the idea of buying a new discman in 2007 was too ridiculous to contemplate. I would have been laughed out of Best Buy. Aesthetics are a little bit different. I continue to wear Chuck Taylors and Vans because I'm as turned off now by extraneous bells-and-whistles as when I was when griping like a 14-year-old Andy Rooney about all the lights and pumps and gels. So I guess sneakers were my inchoate introduction to refusenik simplicity. And if you still want to be cheesily ostentatious, a pair of snakeskin Chucks or slip-ons with stupid flames airbrushed on them are a lot more honest than a goddamn Identi-Kit basketball shoe with a bunch of pointless and ""modern"" plastic gewgaws. Like the late 20th century output of your neighborhood Foot Locker, my recent distaste for electronic music stems from a sterile slickness imposed by the march of technology colliding with an aesthetic asceticism-- an over-articulation of an extremely limited language. Too much ""minimal"" sounds both conceptually thin and sonically fussy. Listening to the new 2xCD Book of Dogma, a collection of rare EPs by famed but obscure proto-IDM act the Black Dog, I was struck on the first few listens by a joyous simplicity that manages never to sit still. Take ""Seer and Sages"", which, over a beat that never deviates from its two loud thwacks, shifts from boogaloo house pianos to techno synthesizers recast as ""Baby Elephant Walk"" baseball stadium muzak to an agitated rave spasm of pure noise to an outro as delicate as anything off a Kompakt Pop Ambient LP. If, as with the crude, cut-up New York house and sparkling Detroit techno they were inspired by, time has somewhat dulled the shine of the Black Dog's sonics, it's also made the music sound more direct and engaging than ever by cultural contrast. To flip another non-musical metaphor, minimal can feel like the suspended animation slog of non-narrative avant-garde filmmaking in THX/IMAX fidelity, but these early Black Dog tracks are like a spelunking spaceman bounding happily through the corny, color-saturated landscape of a no-budget 1980s sci-fi flick with a cranked-up soundtrack of post-Kraftwerk synths, sampled self-help gurus, cosmic divas, distant dog howls, and chirping wind-up birds. Though Book of Dogma comes wrapped in the chilly graphics of a Depeche Mode album, this at times gaudy music, with its barreling melodies and shouting rappers, isn't afraid to get loud in your face; it sounds like an oddball party crasher in glassy, reserved 2007. This out-of-step quality isn't terribly surprising; as the first decade of the 2000s winds to a close, the electronic music of the early 90s, be it of the smarty pants or party hard variety, feels as distant as ""Models Inc."" or Homer Simpson's beloved clear cola. In the light of everything from the rainbow-hued syncopation of 2-step garage to Perlon's thousand dry timbres of percussion, the Dog's very first EP Virtual-- the first three tracks on disc one of Dogma-- sounds stark, like staring into the tie-dye-cum-Rorschach pattern on the original's vinyl label as it spins on your turntable: revolving breakbeat patterns overlaid with creaky synths. But its bold if basic boom-bap is totally appealing, even on the more hi-fi second disc when the trio begins to swing their beats into crunching triplets as on the broken beat foreshadowing ""Vanttool"" or whatever the hell the stop-start lurching astro-samba of ""Erb"" is. ""The Age of Slack"", from the 1989 EP of the same name, is zonked electronic funk with shuffling beats straight off a Rob Base record and bursts of sampled rap; its woozy atmosphere-- that faded soul singer makes the whole thing sound like a stoned take on My Life in the Bush of Ghosts-- slows you down, creating a very different kind of ""slacker"" vibe than contemporaneous Superchunk. I mean, what better way to describe the Dog's music than their own pointed, self-penned epigram ""Ambience with Teeth""? Not everything on Book of Dogma sounds bound to some unrepeatable golden era for nostalgic ravers. ""Glassolalia"" is spare and dark enough to still be easily slotted into a DJ set, and listen to the intro to ""Techno Playtime"" and tell me that Mouse on Mars weren't listening hard. You might say it's silly to pit music from two very different decades against each other, especially considering I can be as much of a sucker for a well-done piece of shiny modern minimalism as anyone. But call me a crank or a grouch or hopelessly out of touch or more interested in aesthetic appeal than the march of technology-- I still can't shake my feeling that too much modern techno has been molded into a slick, aerodynamic Nike-sweatshop anonymity that's more fun to read about than listen to.

Mayoclinic.com tells me its natural for men to experience a drastic decline in their sex drive as a consequence of aging. This is basically also what Brett Anderson tells me with the release of his first solo record. Granted, in the pantheon of Britpop-era sex gods (there's a scary visual), Anderson seemed the most impotent of the bunch; witness his now-famous quip about being a bisexual who'd never had a homosexual experience. Nonetheless, there was a time where Anderson's sexuality was his main currency, and it was powerful enough-- even in its messiness-- to provide the charge for two, maybe even three, great albums. That ember's charcoal now, and has been for a while. Suede ended its run about three years too late, in 2002, with an absolute cannonball of a record. Optimistically titled A New Morning, it was the sound of them morphing into their own, second-rate cover band. In addition to providing just enough warmed-over guitar shapes and dutifully regurgitated SuedeWords™ with which to fill their own grave, it also cast further doubts on Anderson's waning vocal ability. Some speculated that he needed time out of Suede to get back to form; others held out for a far more unlikely scenario-- a reunion with his estranged creative partner, guitarist (and half-Gelfling) Bernard Butler. Flash forward five years later, and both have come to pass. Unfortunately, the Anderson of old appears to have been definitively replaced by the Anderson of Old, the one whose creakier voice we forgive as the least of his crimes. Issued on the heels of Anderson and Butler's underwhelming reunion album as the Tears, this eponymous record marks the singer's first solo release, and demonstrates handily why its taken him this long to do something on his own. Like the Tears record, this is being couched as an off-the-cuff release, less a definitive statement than a modest collection of songs. That low-stakes strategy is savvy, because on his lonesome Anderson is oppressively unimaginative. From his songwriting (verse-chorus-autopilot) to his sounds (a couple of which-- I'm looking at you, ""Scorpio Rising"" and ""Colour of the Night""-- are demo song cheesy) to his lyrics (phoned in as ever), Anderson remains completely eluded by the alien vision that mark his own favorite records. What's worse is that the sexual vigor that used to spark those early Suede songs has been swapped out with straight lethargy; the playful guitar wriggles and flailing energy a thing of the distant past. These days, Anderson is more likely to sing haughtily and preciously about his deceased father, or about the evils of consumerism, or indeed, about nothing much at all. Aside from a lot of filler and a few genuinely horrendous/hilarious missteps (the aforementioned anti-capitalist morality play ""The More We Possess the Less We Own Ourselves"" makes Anne Geddes look like a master of nuance), a few things here are worth sampling. Despite a characteristically silly lyric, ""The Infinite Kiss"" does a reasonable job recalling the epic, lovelorn thing that used to be Suede's stock in trade; ""One Lazy Morning"" is a sweet enough Sunday-morning ballad; and opening track and lead single ""Love Is Dead"" constitutes a nice little comeback moment. ""Nothing ever flows in my life,"" sighs Anderson, ""Love is dead.""

There's so much great music coming out of Japan these days, but let's face it: Buffalo Daughter are pretty average. Though their albums sound nice and pleasingly eclectic, there's very little about them that can be described as memorable. I've listened to New Rock dozens of times and I can't name a single song aside from the infectious ""Great Five Lakes."" I'd sell it, but the swollen ranks of my local record store's Buffalo Daughter used CD rack tells me that a lot of people agree with me. There are two versions of ""Great Five Lakes"" on the new Buffalo Daughter remix EP, WXBD, and both fall far short of the insanely catchy original. Kut Masta Kurt's take does little but unwisely clip the ringing two- chord acoustic riff that makes the song so great. (You know, Kurt's beat- making skills just don't make the grade, and I have to wonder, once again, how his name seems pops up everywhere; see also Kool Keith's solo joints.) And Cornelius has a rare dull track wherein he tosses in a played- out Yes sample and calls it a day. So you wonder how, when my favorite song gets deconstructed and ruined twice, does this album still garner a 5.2? Surprisingly, there's some nice atmosphere going on elsewhere. Someone named Jopolo turns ""Sky High"" into a bubbly, underwater drone- fest, and Nardone's mix of ""Socks Drugs and Rock 'N' Roll"" strips it down into brooding downtempo. I also dig Elite Force's very technoized ""R&B; (Rhythm and Basement)"" with its churning 303 pattern, on- the- beat turntable scratching and positively booty- shaking breakdowns. And the trance- inducing vocal loop on ""Jellyfish Blues"" (remixed by Scratch Pet Land) lies atop a nice bed of digital cuddliness. Come to think of it, my favorite tunes here are the ones that feature less Buffalo Daughter and more remixer.

56,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10040-ruff-draft/,2007-03-27T06:00:01,['J Dilla'],Ruff Draft,"Stones Throw reissues the late producer's transitional 2003 EP-- recorded after the disappointment of having two major-label releases shelved-- adding a handful of bonus tracks and a disc of instrumentals. James Dewitt Yancey probably toasted the arrival of 2003 with a champagne bottle in one hand and a middle finger aimed over his shoulder on the other. 2002 was the year he abandoned his previous recording moniker-- Jay Dee-- so Jermaine ""J.D."" Dupri wouldn't get his phone calls by mistake, as well as the year the newly-rechristened J Dilla left his longtime group Slum Village and set his sights on getting some of that major label exposure. Unfortunately, MCA Records wound up permanently shelving his two major projects (a still-unreleased solo album and a record he produced for fellow Detroiters Frank-N-Dank, the oft-bootlegged 48 Hours), while the most prominent album he had a hand in-- Common's Electric Circus, which featured his co-production on several tracks-- was widely ridiculed by critics and fans as a pretentious mess. Maybe he took it all in stride, but the first album of new material that Dilla released in 03 didn't entirely show it. There was a noticeable sense of sub-surface tension in his Ruff Draft EP: Dilla's spoken intro crackles with a certain reactionary intensity when he states that the record is ""real live shit...sounds like it's straight from the motherfuckin' cassette,"" and the increasingly raw, psychedelic-soul tone that his beats set feels like a subtle but deliberate shift in perspective. Even the name hints at a plan to redraw his schematics and push away from what might have been the onset of an industry-bullshit-driven creative rut. The fact that Ruff Draft was pressed only on vinyl and distributed in limited numbers meant that this shift wouldn't manifest itself to a wider extent until his Madlib collaboration Champion Sound. By the time that album was released later in 03, the rawness had fully set in to his warm, soul-clap funk, so Ruff Draft eventually wound up one of independent hip-hop's great lost transitional-phase documents. It's been over a year since Dilla's passing, and since his legend continues to spur a demand for underheard, rare, or repurposed material, Stones Throw's reissue of Ruff Draft comes at an ideal time. Considering where Dilla was at during this record's creation, honing and refining a more underground-hardcore edge to his craft, it's not a huge stylistic leap back from his most recent output. But if this EP stands up as more than just a filled-in blank, it's probably because what few songs there are at the core-- only eight full-length tracks, with all but two under 2:45-- tend to pack a lot of heat into a little space. Anyone who picked up last year's Stones Throw comp Chrome Children has already heard the highlight of this set, a dope-haze banger called ""Nothing Like This"". The track rides on a backwards acid-rock guitar loop, Dilla's haltingly sung-shouted, methodically rhythmic lovestruck testifying (""you-showed-me, the, light, uh-huh/got-to-have, you, right, a-way"") and a massive beat that trades his tendency for billowy-soft percussive dampening for a bassbin-destroying Goliath stride. For something that only lasts two and a half minutes and feels about a minute shorter, it's instantly captivating. And there's a handful of other tracks that could easily justify a purchase for any Dilla fiend: ""Reckless Driving"" features the producer/MC quoting Biggie's ""Hypnotize"" and spitting windows-down whip-appeal verses; the production relies heavily on a droning space-goth synth, which gives the track a retro feel-- but retro when, exactly, feels elusive. East Coast hardcore tribute ""Make'em NV""-- which samples verses from M.O.P.'s ""Ante Up (Robbing-Hoodz Theory)""-- captures the early 90s NYC production grime that turned soul-jazz and fusion into some of the most sinister, cinematic hip-hop ever made, but does it with a vibe/xylophone sound that strongly resembles the incidental music from ""The Flinstones"". And ""Wild"" is a ridiculous gimmick turned moment of brilliance: a raspy little kid belts Slade's ""Cum on Feel the Noize"" over a stitched-together drum break that sounds sick in both senses of the word, but once the borderline-subliminal murmur of the electric piano and snap-clap rhythm come in, everything falls into place-- it's as though the toddler-sung ""Guns of Brixton"" interlude from the Clash's Sandinista! suddenly transformed into a lo-fi circa-99 Neptunes demo. But even with a few other quality club/sitting-around-in-your-basement-getting-high tracks (especially ""Crushin' (Yeeeeaah!)"", which turns his Ummah-era smoothness into slick let's-fuck rowdiness), Ruff Draft still feels like a limited-edition collectors-only curiosity. Even with some previously unreleased bonus tracks and an extra disc featuring instrumental versions of all the songs, it's a bit slight on content. (Not to mention that using two CDs for under an hour's worth of music seems like the definition of pointless-- but at least it costs the same as a single disc.) And even though Dilla's ability on the mic fits comfortably enough into the tone of his productions-- iced-out club rap buried under a layer of static and noise that makes it feel like a bootleg 4th-generation version (""straight from the motherfuckin' cassette"" is right)-- it sometimes comes across as a bit half-formed, especially in light of his subsequent, somewhat more polished performances on Champion Sound. Still, there's something about eBay-bait and elusive micropressings that practically demand to be listened to once they reach the mass market. And whether or not Dilla would've eventually reissued this if he hadn't passed away, having another, scarcely-heard handful of his tracks readily available to a wider audience isn't something that can be easily dismissed, no matter how sparse the offerings are. Now all we need to do is get someone to call up MCA's people and get them to crack open their vaults.",J Dilla: Ruff Draft Album Review | Pitchfork,6.8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
57,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10041-the-time-has-come-1967-73/,2007-03-30T05:00:01,['Pentangle'],The Time Has Come: 1967-73,"Bert Jansch's legendary British group-- which explored the intersections between folk, blues, and jazz-- is the subject of this mammoth 4xCD retrospective. Along with the Incredible String Band and Fairport Convention, Pentangle was one of the major pioneering forces to first put British folk-rock on the map in the 1960s, and their distinctive hybrid of folk, blues, and jazz has-- for better and sometimes worse-- subsequently inspired countless musicians to follow their progressive trail. Despite their legion of disciples, however, their true influence has always been tempered by the fact that few groups could hope to duplicate Pentangle's unique chemistry or sheer instrumental prowess, attributes which are in lavish display on the mammoth 4xCD retrospective The Time Has Come: 1967-73. Pentangle's music has been frequently anthologized over the years, including-- confusingly enough-- on two separate compilations entitled Light Flight. And while it can't be said to be entirely comprehensive, The Time Has Come does provide a balanced portrait of the freewheeling group's six-year career. Extensively illustrated and annotated, the collection features excerpts from each of their studio albums, re-mastered singles and B-sides, as well as the requisite passel of previously unreleased live tracks and rarities. Containing nearly five hours of music and packed with a variety of astonishing curios, the set ultimately manages to feel rather definitive, and does well to capture Pentangle in all their brilliance, self-indulgent excess, and period splendor. By the time Pentangle formed in 1967, guitarists Bert Jansch and John Renbourn were already well-established talents on the English folk scene. The two had previously issued an album together as a duo, utilizing what became known as a ""folk baroque"" fingerpicking style that drew heavily upon the influence of innovative British folk guitarist Davy Graham. Joining them to round out Pentangle was vocalist Jacqui McShee, who was also an experienced performer on the folk circuit, and the veteran jazz rhythm section of double bass player Danny Thompson and drummer Terry Cox. Once so assembled, Pentangle's core quintet were capable of an extraordinary versatility, and quickly proved themselves equally adept at covering 17th century English folk ballads, Charles Mingus' ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"", or the Jaynetts girl-group classic ""Sally Go Round the Roses"". Moreover, Pentangle's ability to transverse musical boundaries soon became so seamless and organic as to be almost invisible, as when Renbourn delicately weaves an exotic sitar line through the group's version of the traditional English ballad ""Cruel Sister"". And though many of their bold stylistic moves have since been rendered into coffeehouse cliché by lesser talents, there are still many moments of dazzling invention and surprise to be discovered all across The Time Has Come. The collection's first two discs are assembled chronologically, interspersing album tracks with various outtakes, BBC sessions, and non-album rarities. This arrangement surely caused the set's curators to make some tough calls and quirky decisions, such as leaving off the studio versions of many of Pentangle's better known songs (""Let No Man Steal Your Thyme"", ""Sally Free and Easy"") and drastically editing down their 1970 side-long epic ""Jack Orion."" Nevertheless these two discs do an admirable job illustrating the gradual evolution of Pentangle's remarkable chemistry. On early tracks ""Waltz"" and ""Travelling Song""-- both recorded at the time of Pentangle's 1968 debut album-- the group sound tentative, feeling its way around incorporating its diverse sonic elements. By the time of such 1969's Basket of Light and 1970's Cruel Sister, however, Pentangle were operating as an incomparable whole, with McShee's frequently sublime vocals perfectly complemented by Jansch and Renbourn's atmospheric guitar work. The group's easy compatibility is particularly evident on the set's live material, such as on a version of Basket of Light's ""Hunting Song"" which was recorded at BBC for John Peel's Top Gear. Longtime Pentangle fans will likely have something of a mixed reaction to The Time Has Come's third disc, which consists of a live concert recorded at Royal Festival Hall in June, 1968. Twelve of the concert's songs were originally released on 1968's Sweet Child double album, and seven others were included on a 2001 re-master of the album. Here the tracks have been re-sequenced and cleaned up, with much of the between-song banter and applause removed. Though this remains a solid performance, this set might feel a tad redundant to anyone already familiar with Sweet Child, and more impatient listeners might find themselves wishing the producers had also seen fit to edit out a bass solo or two. The Time Has Come reserves its real treasure trove for last, as the final disc is entirely filled with previously unreleased material, most of which is of an uncommonly high caliber. Several of these unearthed tracks were recorded live for various TV broadcasts between 1970-72, and find the group at their most dynamic and expansive. In fact, on some of these performances, Pentangle begin to almost resemble an British response to the Grateful Dead, an impression that is further amplified by their live version of the longtime Dead staple ""Cold Rain and Snow"". This comparison is likely most valid on the live, 19-minute interpretation of the group's signature ""Pentangling"", whose electric figures and wayfaring improvisations can sound much more in line with the Avalon Ballroom than the English countryside. Most curious of all is the set's inclusion of not one but two title works from film soundtracks, ""Tam Lin"" and ""Christian the Lion"", that were digitally pieced together from individual verses used as in the films as a narrative device. Needless to say, the practice of using ethereal folk songs as a cinematic framing device is one that has sadly gone out of fashion, and the presence of these offbeat tracks reinforces the impression of Pentangle as a group who were wholly and intrinsically of their time. And though echoes of the group's artistic legacy still resonate in Jansch's current solo work, and in the music of such younger artists as Espers, Devendra Banhart, and Vetiver, The Time Has Come should stand as further evidence that we'll not soon see Pentangle's like again.",Pentangle: The Time Has Come: 1967-73 Album Review | Pitchfork,8.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The Anticon label is usually home to unorthodox hip-hop and electronic music, but they've made an exception for Why? cohort SJ Esau's first label-distributed solo album. Though Sam Wisternoff began his music career rapping in his hometown of Bristol, England (at age eight, no less), under the SJ Esau tag he focuses on atmospheric indie rock that borrows from the Scottish post-rock scene and Hood. A few moments stand out-- usually by impressing with a unique or unexpected texture-- but for the most part, it seems Wisternoff could stand to tighten the c-clamp on his head, as pictured on the album's cover. Focused melodies simply don't live here, which makes it hard to keep coming back to even the better arrangements. Wisternoff's reedy voice isn't bad, but he gives himself little to work with on songs like ""Wears the Control"" and ""The Wrong Order"", which seem far more concerned with creating a sound rather than doing something with that sound. The latter of the two takes textural experimentation too far, including a loop of some sort of scraping noise that drives me up the wall. Promise peeks out of first song ""Cat Track (He Has No Balls)"", which begins inauspiciously with Wisternoff playing the exact same melody he's singing on his acoustic guitar, but briefly breaks into a careening midsection led by a dagger-sharp violin phrase that sounds like it could have come off a mid-1970s King Crimson record. It veers back to an acoustic arrangement before a thrashing coda, manipulating pop form in an interesting way while wielding sharp dynamic shifts, but it's ultimately not terribly memorable. Wisternoff's tendency to double his vocals with keyboard, guitar or violin is one of the things that holds the album back. It's partly because the tunes are too basic and static, but it's also the fact that there's usually only one thing going on at a time, and one thing isn't enough with this kind of music. ""Geography (Donkey Dancing in the Bath)"" only gets interesting when he hands the vocal melody off to a solo trumpet and ramps up the arrangement with bashing drums. The best song on the album is the one that doesn't feel like it belongs here: ""Halfway up the Pathway"" is a solo acoustic number recorded in the most rudimentary fashion, but it has a fantastic vocal with a Syd Barrett feel and Wisternoff's strumming is spry and lively. It's just about perfect, but Wisternoff doesn't seem to agree, uselessly appending a coda that consists of the rest of the song annoyingly chopped to bits and mixed up. Though it has its moments, they're not enough to save Wrong-Faced Cat Feed Collapse from mediocrity. Wisternoff certainly knows how to handle timbre and tone, but without marrying them to song, he's created an overly uniform record that doesn't stick.",SJ Esau: Wrong-Faced Cat Feed Collapse Album Review | Pitchfork,4.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The Howling Bells' self-titled debut begins with a guitar scribbling stoically for a few measures, setting a mood of expectant possibility for the opener, ""The Bell Hit"". From this sound, the song could emerge as anything and the band could sound like anyone. The next thing you hear, however, is Juanita Stein's voice, which is thoroughly unexpected, confidently strange, and immediately commanding. She delivers a lilting tune for the first verse, breaking her syllables into melodic filigrees that sound simultaneously angelic and demonic. Then ""The Bell Hit"" takes another turn when the band reaches the chorus and the song becomes a country sing-along. The Howling Bells have some surprises, for sure. All of the sounds on ""The Bell Hit"" and the dozen songs that follow become familiar: the dark rumble of ""Low Happening"" and ""Broken Bones"" recalls Lush and Mazzy Star, the sweeping melody of ""In the Woods"" is full-on Fuzzy-era Grant Lee Buffalo, and Stein's vocals bring to mind anyone from the Sundays' Harriet Wheeler to Cocteau Twins' Liz Frazer to Patsy Cline. And yet, the Howling Bells touch on these fairly obvious influences without sounding dated, revivalist, or imitative. In fact, until a last-minute lull, the album sounds vital and even occasionally thrilling, powered by the band's muscular sound and the lively production by Ken Nelson, whose work with Coldplay and Gomez never hinted at his facility for a dirtier, more ominous atmosphere. Because they have a clear affection for old country music and rural instrumentation, the Howling Bells have been referred to as country-goth, but they're actually no more goth than any hard-living, hard-drinking country act from the last 50 years (and certainly nowhere near as goth as fellow Aussie Nick Cave). Slower songs like ""The Bell Hit"" and ""I'm Not Afraid"" kick around country-road guitar licks and shuffle along on Glenn Moule's brushed snare. Stein sings so convincingly about world-weary pub pathos-- that inexhaustible country subject-- on ""Broken Bones"" and ""The Night Is Young"" that she must have first-hand experience. ""You drink from the heart and you pour from the soul,"" she sings on ""Low Happening"" as the guitars snarl. ""You listen to trash but it's my rock 'n' roll!"" Gloom and doom reign on this album, and not just because death looms around the corner-- which it certainly does-- but because Stein doesn't see enough life going on around her to make death meaningful. Currently, the Bells' debut is available in America only as a pricey import, although it's been widely heralded in England and Australia. As of this writing, the band has not signed an American distribution deal, but one is surely forthcoming, right? When they do reach these shores, who knows how they'll be greeted? Perhaps their impact will be as limited as that of the bands mentioned above: a few songs popular enough to be loudly requested at live shows by loyal fans, probably a song on a television montage, maybe even a best-of comp and a mention as an influence for some future band. These songs make clear that the Howling Bells know there are worse things.

As the leader of New Zealand band the Clean, David Kilgour has been responsible for some of the most carefree and jubilant rock music ever put to tape. The band's debut single ""Tally Ho"" is punk without posturing; a simple riff played loud, fast, and sloppy, perfectly capturing the excitement of picking up an instrument and making music on it. Some 25 years later, Kilgour seems to be growing older with the same enthusiasm and charm: His latest, The Far Now, is a solid and understated album, at times slow and meandering but never plodding or dull. Opener ""Sun of God"" distills the psychedelic pop of Kilgour's previous solo records into immaculate plucked acoustic guitars and a single buzzing drone. This is not music designed for instant gratification; it evolves slowly, and repeats frequently. Still, Kilgour knows to quit when he's ahead; ""Sun of God"", like the majority of tracks on The Far Now, clocks in at under three minutes. Many of these songs explore a single musical figure or idea with grace and restraint, fading out with minimal fanfare before they become dull or grating. The relaxed tone of The Far Now particularly suits the album's tighter and more dramatic moments. A potentially schmaltzy string arrangement on ""On Your Own"" is tempered by the effortlessness of Kilgour's voice. Kilgour expertly tows line between artful familiarity and cliché, especially during the album's strong second half. ""I'm Gonna Get Better Lately"" seamlessly merges twang and atmosphere. ""I Cut My Heart Out Once"" evokes the spare, impressionistic folk of Robyn Hitchcock. Instrumental album closer ""Out of the Moment"" brings to mind the dusty ambiance of Dirty Three, and packs enough subtle builds and dips to maintain its momentum over seven minutes. Interestingly, The Far Now is quite possibly the most dated-sounding thing Kilgour has ever released. The album's instrumental textures and lyrical concerns (see, especially, ""Wave of Love"") are miles away from most contemporary music, let alone ""cool"" contemporary music. But more often than not, Kilgour crafts these anachronisms into artifacts of wistful nostalgia.  With so many indie bands shooting for far-reaching and ""ambitious"" sounds, it's easy for something as unassuming as The Far Now to fall through the cracks. This is not revelatory music, nor does it seek to be. Instead, The Far Now evokes a kind of humble ease seldom heard these days, and rarely executed this well.",David Kilgour: The Far Now Album Review | Pitchfork,7.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
61,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10045-night-of-the-furies/,2007-04-06T06:00:02,['The Rosebuds'],Night of the Furies,"The third and best album from the North Carolina husband/wife duo is an unexpected turn toward new romantic synthpop, a fitting pallette for a collection of darkly romantic songs about love, betrayal, and loss. The Rosebuds' 2003 debut, The Rosebuds Make Out, emerged within the small-but-noisy couplecore movement, situating the duo amongst Mates of State, Quasi, the White Stripes, and later, Matt & Kim. The thematic, and possibly autobiographical, trajectory of Ivan Howard and Kelly Crisp's records since, however, have set them a shade apart from their contemporaries. Their two subsequent records-- including their latest and best release, Night of the Furies-- have collectively traced the path of a boy/girl relationship with rich detail and no shortage of passion. Make Out's version of lust was colored with the silly joy of youthful infatuation; chipper and hooky, its organ-laden songs extolled the virtues of playgrounds, hanging out with friends, and kissing. 2005's Birds Make Good Neighbors followed its predecessor's frolicking with songs about adult responsibilities and building a life together. The most appealing (and overlooked) aspect of Neighbors, however, was the melodramatic urgency the duo employed to elevate a set of songs about domesticity to the realm of a housebound West Side Story. Songs like ""Outnumbered"", ""The Lovers' Rights"", and irresistable opener ""Hold Hands and Fight"" peppered their version of Paul and Linda's McCartney with pep-rally cheers and handclaps, all delivered with the playful fervency of a campfire singalong. Settling down seldom sounds as much fun. For its part, Night of the Furies retains the urgency and emotional mobilization of Neighbors, but with a darker edge. The record chronicles the melodramatic relationship stage when misunderstandings and differences are fended off with an impassioned hope for a mutual future. Neighbors' chants are back, but with a different, less playful tone. Perhaps the most significant weapon in Ivan and Kelly's arsenal this time around is their pallette. The songs themselves are similar to, if not more emotionally and musically complex than, those on Neighbors, but they're presented with a stylistic left turn that in itself is an act of bravery. The genre classification ""new romantic"" certainly wasn't coined to refer to musicians who themselves were experiencing a fresh relationship, but Furies' omnipresent (and indeed surprising) use of synthesizers, echoed vocals, and drum machines lend it a gravity and immediacy that it wears very well. Different listeners will no doubt disagree on which synth-pop predecessor, or combination thereof, is the most fitting point of comparison-- there is definitely plenty of Pet Shop Boys, Roxy Music's Avalon, Duran Duran, New Order, Spandau Ballet, and Simple Minds on this record for days of deliberation-- but like Lansing-Dreiden's The Dividing Island, Furies is no retro-fetishistic pastiche. The darkly drawn glamour of early 80s synth-pop is the perfect fit for this cinematically inclined collection of songs. Furies is well-sequenced, and bookended with its two finest songs. On album-opener ""My Punishment for Fighting"" (the chorus of which is a sax-refrain away from ""Careless Whisper"", and this is not a bad thing), Howard alternates a dinner-club baritone on the verse with his more recognizable high-register croon on the chorus, as a percolating synth bubbles underneath, and lonely piano plinks mirror the lyrical regret of a man who has seemingly thrown in the towel: ""I could never be all you need me to, my punishment is living without you."" The title track that closes the record is its finest moment, however; a stark, poetic, tuxedoed lament masquerading as mythology. A skittering, funky hi-hat and snare patter pecks at Howard's impeccably smooth tenor, which consistently echoes and interupts itself. The idleness of a stable life have triggered uncomfortable recollections for him, and he intones: ""There's calm in these banquet years, so I tend to obsess about youth, before the guilt appeared. But I need to forget."" In between these two high points, Howard and Crisp navigate the choppy waters of romance with introspection, sentimentality, and barely restrained flamboyance, using Crisp's placid, hollow vocals to spooky effect. ""Cemetery Lawns"" is a great example of Furies' dark theatre, a raved-up battle emerging from a wedding gone wrong. Crisp plays the role of the bloodied bride there, before turning paranoid on ""I Better Run"" and ""When the Lights Went Dim"" after realizing, respectively, that an expected inheritance from a relative might hold more trouble than it's worth, and that a lover may not have survived a mysterious calamity. With Night of the Furies, the Rosebuds have cemented their knack for interpretation and their continued willingness to imaginatively explore all facets of romantic relationships. Their two prior LPs progressed in the exaggerated manner of a dramatic serial, with each record increasing the emotional and creative stakes, and Furies feels like the culmination of an extended narrative.",The Rosebuds: Night of the Furies Album Review | Pitchfork,7.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

After a long March of performances with their equally spine-tingling labelmates Parenthetical Girls, the Dead Science will spend much of April 2007 on tour with the Blood Brothers and Celebration, groups so singularly odd that their mere existence (much less their fellow-traveling) might end the debate about how the ""disco fad"" is homogenizing indie rock. You've almost got to love how unpitchable the Dead Science are, as anyone trying to encapsulate them ends up sounding like an arse: Mutant showtunes for an anarchic codeine cabaret! Murder ballads for a no-wave speakeasy! Prom jams for masochistically patient goths! Grownup, tortured slow-burn music about teenage longing, like a less poppy Twilight Singers or Arab Strap, except taking dissonant turns (via chords that might be considered mistakes by one's old strip-mall guitar tutor) into neighborhoods patrolled by Dominique Leone! Oh yeah, with a vocalist who sounds like PJ Harvey's corpse somehow revived in a nitrous oxide tank, or an emphesemic Hedwig trying to fearfinger a Jimmy Scott fleshlight, or, er, Prince bound and gagged singing through a Miss Piggy costume... So: if the Junior Boys went analog and were sicker fucks? Crepuscule contains two loping songs from the Frost Giant sessions that would have brought that record's fever down, one of which is a funereal rendition of a composition by the ever-depressed John Dowland-- yes, the lutenist from four hundred years ago whom Sting just revisited for an album. Of the newer material, ""Displacer Beast"" comes closest to being a manifesto for this trio's ambitions, homaging the classic belligerent, perception-bending hybrid monster from Dungeons & Dragons, and wishing for even more disorienting power: to be ""something else forever."" The remaining tracks pivot on sweet shocks, an organ squall here and a sustained howl there, best listened to instead of typed about, lest one be forced to trot out pairs of opposites such as ""fluid and impenetrable"" or ""desiccated and elegant"" to describe them. Sam Mickens' lyrics are buried in his of-a-hellish-piece-with-the-music delivery; he may as well distribute burning valentines or print obituaries in inscrutable fonts. Sarah Meadows' three photographs for the packaging are just as slithery: Are the gender-indeterminate people that they depict dead in the woods, or just lying down?

At this point, it's no secret that Fountains of Wayne are not the world's best lyricists. I could fill this review with forced, awkward, and downright embarrassing lines from Traffic and Weather, but few people are looking to this band for lyrical wit and insight. Eleven years after releasing their excellent self-titled debut, Fountains of Wayne have found success doing one thing and one thing alone: serving bite-size and easy-to-swallow nuggets of cultural nostalgia. And they have the résumé to prove it; along with the shamelessly Cars-aping mega-hit ""Stacy's Mom"", primary songwriter Adam Schlesinger famously penned the songs for the Tom Hanks-directed 1996 film That Thing You Do! as well as providing songs for the recent Hugh Grant/Drew Barrymore vehicle Music and Lyrics. Somewhere along the line, the band gave up on the slightly ramshackle charm that made their debut so exciting. With the addition of a professional backing band on 1999's Utopia Parkway, Schlesinger and co-songwriter Chris Collingwood no longer needed to strip each song down to its essential hook and mood. Rather than evoking a playful sense of whimsy, the band was free to actually recreate the sound of rock music pasts, giving their subtler songs more muscle but also opening the door to some truly awful genre pastiche. My biggest gripe with ""Stacy's Mom"" wasn't its obvious nod to ""Just What I Needed"" or its even more obvious lyrical flaws, but rather that the song's verses seemed like tossed-off filler to kill time before the big chorus. Apparently, they've taken the song's success to heart; at its best, Traffic and Weather sounds like a collection of big-hook choruses strung together with half-hearted chugging build-ups. At its worst... well, it's far and away the most forgettable thing the band has ever released. Opener and leadoff single ""Somebody to Love"" sets the tale of two lonely young urbanites to crunchy guitars and a big, disco-thumping chorus. It's chock full of cultural references (Coldplay, ""The King of Queens""), and succeeds in creating a generic sense of drama between verse and chorus. But, like most of Traffic and Weather, it ultimately comes down to a progression of easy and unmemorable musical choices. Yes, it ""works,"" but only in the way that a crummy sitcom or a slick Hollywood date movie works. That said, ""Somebody to Love"" is one of the album's high points.  ""92 Subaru"", for instance, sounds like a remake of Adam Sandler's ""Piece of Shit Car"" minus the novelty. Elsewhere, the band seems to be veering increasingly towards stories and ""themes"" in their songs, and the results can be pretty nightmarish-- it's all forced structure and no payoff, like a joke stripped of its humor. And don't even get me started on ""Planet of Weed"". We should expect much, much more from pop music than this kind of bullshit. ""Yeah, but it's fun,"" or ""it works for what it is"" are merely excuses for mediocrity, which this album has in abundance-- none of these songs hit with the irresistible hook overload of their earliest work, or even of ""Stacy's Mom"".  Fountains of Wayne have proven themselves capable songwriters, both as scrappy underdogs and as pop superstars, but Traffic and Weather finds them treading water in the worst possible way.",Fountains of Wayne: Traffic and Weather Album Review | Pitchfork,3.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
64,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10048-buck-the-world/,2007-04-03T05:00:04,['Young Buck'],Buck the World,"Nashville rapper's sophomore album showcases his gruff, damaged baritone and his darker, violent side. The appeal of Nashville rapper Young Buck isn't immediately evident. He's neither as clever as Bun B nor as witty as Biggie, and he doesn't begin to approach the charisma of a T.I. or the talent of Lil' Wayne. Buck's shtick, quite simply, is that he's sounds like a very real dude. Sure, authenticity is a slippery notion, but it is integral to the appeal of Buck the World and is at least, in part, explainable. Much of it has to with Buck's voice-- a gruff, damaged baritone that is both punishing and straining-- but it's also because his rhymes are three dimensional. Listen to the first verse on ""Look at Me Now"", from his debut, where Buck lights ""cancer sticks"" beneath streetlights, wondering how to get his mother out of ""bricks"" that have neither lights nor water. That desire is undercut by reality, and soon Buck quips that ""Er'body got a grave, we just waitin' to go to it."" Or listen to ""Slow Your Roll"", from the occasionally satisfying yet largely disappointing sophomore album, Buck the World, where he tenderly recounts friends, lovers and neighbors who died too early. Of course, it also doesn't hurt his cred that Buck (aka David Darnell Brown) stabbed a man in front of cameras at the 2004 Vibe Awards, and later, amazingly, walked out of court with only a three-year probationary period. That darker, violent side is also apparent on Buck the World, and tracks such as the title track, ""Push 'Em Back"" and ""Buss Yo' Head"" are pure bluster. His haters, in particular, have it hard. They're ""broke bitches"" who ""won't say it to my face"" and meet a variety of ends, all unpleasant. Buck will creep out from under their beds and bust their ""motherfucking head."" He'll kidnap their children (who conveniently attend the same school as Buck's kids) and he brings an AK to the club. You know the drill. These raps pander to Buck's devotees, but they alienate Buck from pop audiences and undermine his credibility. Though these tracks largely avoid the wealth porn evident on his guest spot on Lil' Scrappy's single ""Money in the Bank"", they are are still fantastical and hyper-stylized, and they grow old quickly, especially when the beats are as dull as they are here. Sure, ""4 Kings""-- featuring T.I., Young Jeezy, and Pimp C-- and ""Get Buck"" are hot, but these sort of tracks worked better on Buck's debut. The hooks were bigger and more memorable, and regardless of how you feel about them personally, G-Unit members 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks and expat the Game are great studio gangstas. Which brings us to one of the biggest differences between World and his previous album, Straight Outta Cashville. Despite his purported allegiance on the meddling ""Clean Up Man"", Buck (or his handlers) are hedging their bets as far as G-Unit is concerned. On Cashville, released at the height of Fiddy's notoriety, members of G-unit popped up on six of the albums 15 tracks. Buck the World only features one G-Unit collaboration, 50 Cent's ""Hold On"". Dre is still around, but he's still in the same lame musak phase as he was on Jay-Z's Kingdom Come. On ""U Ain't Going Nowhere"", he reaches for jazzy nuance, but instead creates something sounds like the music for a cruise commercial. Elsewhere, the red hot Polow Da Don (who produced Rich Boy's smash ""Throw Some D's"") delivers another banger with the trombone laced ""Get Buck"", while ""Haters"", produced by upcoming Seattle beatsmith Vitamin D, is ravaging skeletal soul. The problem with Buck the World is that it's largely inconsistent. There are 15 producers over 17 tracks. Sometimes it clicks, but other times it feels forced. Considering Buck's promises, I 'd hoped for an album along the lines of Scarface's classic My Diary. But in the end, World is too generic and uneven.",Young Buck: Buck the World Album Review | Pitchfork,6.1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The All Music Guide says, cheerily, that Rosie Thomas ""wouldn't sound out of place spilling from the ceiling of an extremely popular coffee house chain."" Indeed, her fourth album, co-produced and with vocal and instrumental assistance from Sufjan Stevens, is full of the kind of basic strum-alongs and diaristic musings that yield showers of Starbucks praise. Such sleepy, easy folk albums as These Friends of Mine seem to be the incantation of some big retirement: from a job, from zest for life, from love, from creativity and insight, from nesting in any neighborhood coffee shop other than the obvious. A song like ""Paper Doll"", a lazy, plucky, empty-room duet with the dull title metaphor at its center is not just background music, it's background thought, a self-indulgent bit of fluff. ""Kite Song"", similarly, is like a foolish, breezy blog entry. Instead of showcasing or exaggerating Thomas' vocal talent with heavy reverbing, the production only exposes the intentional cracks, assumedly meant to represent an emotion we should sympathize with or truly feel. Thomas is a zealous close-talker who ironically discusses the private contents of her romantic life with utmost simplicity and either storybook metaphors or candid platitudes. Take the ridiculous cliché that somehow rises to the heights of emotional climax in ""Much Farther to Go"": ""I have much farther to go/ Everything is so predictable/ I should just click my heels together/ And go home/ But I'm not sure where that is anymore."" The setting of this song is a subway train to Brooklyn Heights, and the subject family, crying, Jesus, ""something about paper dolls,"" and ""something about the cross."" Playing fan's advocate, one could say we are supposed to relate to this song's stream-of-consciousness tale of displacement and Oz, when really there could be nothing more dissatisfying than predictable, entry-level chord progressions following around shallow, first-draft thoughts. For such an experienced singer-songwriter to record and release such simplistic melodies, needless and jarring vocal effects, and déja-vu insights is surprising and negligible. ""Songbird"" is a perfect example of Thomas' ability to straddle two pop-folk musical philosophies and probably gain some sort of following for it: she wavers between the atmospheric swirls and croons of a singer like Sarah McLachlan and the utterly traditional, unfussy, but refreshingly virtuosic work of Lavender Diamond's Becky Stark. Thomas makes a case for both DIY acoustic work and odd vocal add-ons; the difference is that the two elements remain starkly at odds and that the material she writes recalls the above contemporaries only in style, not level of originality. The title track, a fun, lo-fi chorus round at the end of the album, is the only moment of enjoyment here: it's a quiet, sunny blues artifact that, while still superficial, still retains an element of novelty.",Rosie Thomas: These Friends of Mine Album Review | Pitchfork,3.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
66,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10050-ed-rec-vol-2/,2007-03-29T06:00:01,[],Ed Rec Vol. 2,"French Touch imprint Ed Banger offers its second label compilation, and it's another hit-and-miss bag that features tracks by the excellent Justice, SebastiAn, and Mr. Flash, among others. Bob Sinclar's 2006 hit ""Rock This Party""-- an amusing rendezvous between dancehall's Kopa riddim and samples of C+C Music Factory's ""Gonna Make You Sweat"", and by far last year's most perverse French house track-- revealed just how meaningless the separations between French house's underground and overground are. You won't hear anything like the Sinclair track on Ed Rec 2, Ed Banger's second label compilation, although it's not for lack of trying. The stumbling block is in their heads, perhaps: Whereas Ed Banger are stymied by the erroneous assumption that interesting ideas can only be realized at the expense of unambiguously seizing the pop jugular, Sinclar just went out and did both. Ed Rec 2 reveals clearly enough the flaws in the label's aesthetic vision: resident rapper Uffie, already a dubious proposition, sounds positively execrable on her ode to haters, ""Dismissed"", but if this is by far the worst inclusion here, it's not (just) because Uffie can't rap. Blame the creative bankruptcy of the label's intermittent fascination with sneeringly amateurish, stuttery send-ups of old skool electro, which also ruins the Yoko Ono electro of DJ Mehdi's ""Lucky Girl"". These artists should, one and all, give up on trying to tell jokes. Luckily, most of Ed Rec 2 witnesses the label roster in consolidation mode, staging a strategic retreat to the messy, rock-influenced take on French house which Daft Punk codified on Human After All. While the move invites accusations of redundancy, I'm inclined to look upon Ed Banger's reduced expectations with some sympathy. One needs to accept from the outset that Ed Banger are unlikely to produce something as all-conquering as ""Rock & Roll"" or as marvelously confounding as ""Aerodynamic"" in order to fully enjoy the enthusiasm with which they go about colonizing the space between these two poles, from the ridiculous Genesis synth runs of Mr. Flash's ""Disco Dynamite"" to the rusted-on percussion presets of Feadz's lurching ""Edwrecker"". And perhaps some of the elder statesmen's production nous has rubbed off as well. Justice's ""Phantom"" fuses hyper-plasticity with noise for noisiness' sake in characteristic fashion. While it's hardly surprising, it's perhaps the duo's best executed effort to date, the descent from disco sparkle into a mid-range black hole and back out again carried off with agility, even grace. Busy P's ""Rainbow Man"" may simply reiterate the same grinding, slow, mechanical house blueprint that Daft Punk established with ""Steam Machine"" and that SebastiAn has since made his own, but why should we expect more than good craftmanship? Why can't there be an entire genre of these menacingly sexy dominatrix backing tracks? By comparison, SebastiAn's own ""Greel"" is disappointingly lacking in character, its mechanic gewalt expressing brute force but nothing to give that power meaning. Indeed, it's usually when Ed Banger's artists get dark-- rather than merely loud-- that they are most compelling. Far and away the best track on this compilation, Krazy Baldhead's ""Strings of Death"" performs the unlikely feat of summarizing the label's entire aesthetic while sounding like nothing else in its back catalogue, boasting the type of muscular rock groove that the label should have been cornering all along. Instead of settling for a straightahead churn or stomp, it slinks its way around overblown, bluesy guitar riffs while paranoid synths and snapping electro beats add a slight industrial inflection, somewhere between Ministry at their most lithe and Depeche Mode at their most heavy. It's actually thrilling, and I'd wager part of the thrill derives from the unexpectedness of the equation, as if industrial glam-rock is the unintended and explosive result of a naïve French House alchemy experiment. If Ed Banger can only stumble upon greatness by accident, let's hope the artists never work out exactly what it is they're doing on tracks like these.",Various Artists: Ed Rec Vol. 2 Album Review | Pitchfork,6.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The post-Is This It homogenization of much UK guitar pop leaves recovering Britpop fans with a bit of a dilemma: Libertines-like barstool-rock or foppish post-punk moping? Surely not a choice you'd wish on even a critic. To our great relief, the debut albums from the Futureheads and Maxïmo Park stood out for their idea-crammed songs and sharp, catchy melodies, and Arctic Monkeys distinguish themselves through Alex Turner's vivid vernacular. South London's Good Shoes venture into this crowded market with a more streamlined pop take on new wave herky-jerky-- an earnest young Buzzcocks to their rivals' the Clash, the Jam, or XTC. Good Shoes sweeten their spiky guitars, attack/release choruses, and hiccupping vocals with some straightforward songwriting about boys in bands (and the girls who love them). If the Arctic Monkeys' success established a new template for UK teen idoldom-- realistic diaries of underage drinking and nervous romantic conquests, easy on the synths plz-- then Good Shoes paint between the same lines with broader brushstrokes. Extra polish on debut full-length Think Before You Speak helps this group of barely twentysomethings realize the promise shown in about two years' worth of 7""s, EPs, and demos. Still fundamentally a singles band, Good Shoes give us plenty of potential iPod-commercial fodder here. Rickety pop-punker ""The Photos on My Wall"" laments a stupid mouth before breaking into a stylish, Orange Juice-hued midsection. ""My ears are ringing from the night before,"" singer/guitarist Rhys Jones notes, a detail his intended audience can no doubt appreciate. Jones remains an apologetic heartbreaker on ""Never Meant to Hurt You"", perhaps the best (only?) song ever to name-check fluffy J-Lo fable Maid in Manhattan. ""Small Town Girl"", a 2005 single re-recorded for the album, tries to comfort another Hollywood actress with catchy shouts and simple lead guitar. The bickering couple of ""We Are Not the Same"" is another easy entry point, though the title comes across as wishful thinking. Pleasant surprise: Several album tracks sound like potential singles, too. Likely live favorite ""Sophia"" (""all the pretty girls are screaming, 'Take off your pants!'"") again evokes the Arctics with its mention of our underage narrator being tossed from a bar, while ""Everybody's Talking"" enthusiastically tries out the Futureheads' call-and-response guitar intricacies. ""Does it really matter?"" Jones calls at the track's glowing conclusion. As welcome as new sounds would be, Good Shoes at least clean up the old ones for potentially new ears.

Remember 2004? Remember suicidal depression in November, a whole summer spent watching VH1's ""I Love the 90s"", and the swift and vicious post-2 Many DJs backlash against ""eclectic"" DJ mixes? Well three years later, I'm still loving this tendency in 21st century mixology to just play whatever sounds good, regardless of genre or year of release. Besides, backlash comes and goes. The deserved acclaim thrown at the feet of Scottish duo Optimo is proof that even grouchy grousers have grown more comfortable with a generation of DJs out to keep on unearthing cool old music. All they're trying to do is share, you know. Optimo's JD Twitch lent a hand with the recording for Justine D's Mx5, the latest mix CD from New York's Rvng boutique, following top shelf limited edition discs from Crazy Rhythms (the duo of Dan Selzer and Mike Simonetti) and DFA duder Tim Sweeney. Unlike Optimo's mixes-- potentially deadly acts of multi-track chainsaw juggling pulled off with the blithe, dizzying panache of assured showmen-- Justine D blends and bleeds across eras with just your traditional DJ fades and chops, while still casting a wide net for cool records. A jury of cranky dance music fans might look at the tracklist for Mx5 and simply conclude ""eclectic,"" but I'm fairly comfortable saying it's the first mix CD to ever feature Chic, Crass, and the Cars. But like kohl around the eye, Justine D traces a small, dark spot on the dancefloor where flamboyant goth-pop, haughty electro(clash), hypnotic techno, rigid EBM, concrete block German new wave, skeletal punk, and glam-era Bowie all intersect. (She takes a short side trip at the start for a little shoegaze'n'sitars psychedelic baggy.) It's a mid-tempo nighttime stroll through various districts of black-clad clubland, dour disco for dancing in place. Not for nothing does she choose the strings from the most zombie-zonked of Chic tracks, the ravenous but exhausted plea of ""I Want Your Love"". The smashed neon and burnt chrome of Mx5's proto-techno and bleak disco could be the soundtrack to Blade Runner's wayward replicant Priss, lost on 2014's Hollywood Boulevard Babylon. Despite contemporary DJs and mp3 blog culture making formerly forbidden found sounds like Mick Fleetwood afro-disco tracks and Alan Parsons Project album cuts cool for old punkers and nu-ravers alike, many are still wary of anything tagged in iTunes as ""goth"" or ""industrial."" My primary introduction to dance music came from an older girlfriend who had grown up and through the succession of 80s electronic beat music, from synthpop to industrial, hitting New York after college just as house music did. Listening to Mx5 brought back some pretty uncanny memories from the years we dated-- learning about Nitzer Ebb and the Orb at the same time, getting into arguments about Ministry on the subway, slowly shedding my prejudices via rock- and foot-friendly bands like Christian Death that all goth had be a) Slow, and b) Terrible. (All of my fellow My Chemical Romance fans are urged to check out Only Theatre of Pain.) All of those artists are on Mx5, snug in the DJ box next to more expected fare such as Hot Chip, Delia and Gavin, and Italian synth-soundtrack maestros Goblin-- whose nightmarish combo of distant drums, music box chimes, gargling vocals, and death-folk guitar is the creepiest thing on the disc, and that's before it turns into a funk rock record produced by Giorgio Moroder in Grandpa Munster drag. Surprise, surprise-- it all sounds great. I'm not convinced enough to go trawling through the Wax Trax stax just yet, but isn't that why we keep DJs around, to find these shiny lumps of coal?

You'd have to be pretty heartless to hate a purdy little folk album like Human Like a House. For one thing, the San Franciscan duo the Finches stick to a bare-boned style that's loyal to the genre's oldest roots-- we're talking troubadour music here. They even break into ""Auld Lang Syne"" midway through one track. On their entire innocuous debut, there's not a single musical curveball-- not even one syncopated note-- that'd catch a listener off guard, mainly because jolting the listener would rudely distract him or her from one of singer Carolyn Pennypacker Riggs's heartwarming lyrical tales. However, like mom and pop stores or VHS cassettes, the Finches have trouble competing with 21st century innovations and trends, and Human's backward thinking, front-porch-rocking-chair charisma pales in comparison to more progressive folk contemporaries. Riggs and childhood chum/guitarist Aaron Morgan rely exclusively on a two-guitar formula that seldom strays from a beginner's chord book, making them pretty anachronistic at a time when most ""folk"" exposure comes via Animal Collective or Joanna Newsom. Even the most wholesome, grassroots indie acts would only record one or two songs like these per album, mainly as novelty. As admirable as the Finches' dedication to simplicity may be, the three-chord limitation bleeds most of the songs together, or, even worse, renders them indistinguishable from lullabies or nursery rhymes. Human does have its bright spots, and, no surprise, they occur on the most nuanced tracks. ""Last Favor"" tumbles over one of the album's few basslines, and Morgan's backup vocals help amplify some of Riggs's sharpest hooks. Likewise, Riggs's haunting coos on ""The House Under the Hill"" manage to capture the otherwise painfully absent sense of mysticism and wonder that should be a gimme for folk. Unfortunately, these highlights fail to offset the album's supposed centerpieces. ""Nightswimming, AR"" has all the trappings of a show-stopping ballad, replete with nostalgic kiss-and-tell lyrics and Riggs' intimate half-sung, half-whispered melody. However, the track fails musically to make the sultry story compelling as the guitars move through one predictable chord after another. Likewise, the sentimental ""Leviathans Home!"" closes an album that already has eleven other wistful closers willing to bid the listener a tender adieu. This emotional flatline best underscores House's laundry list of shortcomings as an album not entirely guilty of simplicity or folk fundamentalism, but rather the Finches' ennui in delivering it. Sadly, the title falsely advertises, suggesting a record that captures the human condition. Instead, we get an album as mechanical and soulless as a computer-generated simulation.",The Finches: Human Like a House Album Review | Pitchfork,4.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Before we get to what Young Galaxy are, we should talk about what they aren't. While the Canadian duo records for the Arts & Crafts label, they aren't really comparable to Broken Social Scene, the flagship band that all other A&C bands are weighed against. At first blush, Young Galaxy resembles BSS in some superficial ways: namely, their limpid production and cosmic melodies. But BSS's definitive qualities-- ramshackle energy and genre-bending curveballs-- do not factor into Young Galaxy's orderly dream-pop. Neither is the duo, comprised of Stephen Ramsay and Catherine McCandless, the Stars side project they've often been touted to be. Ramsay was Stars' touring guitarist (a position he's vacated to focus on Young Galaxy), not a permanent fixture or songwriter in the band. If you come to Young Galaxy expecting a Stars record, you will be disappointed-- they work in muted pastels, not blinding neon; they're deliberate where Stars are immediate. Their most obvious influences are the deep-space arrangements of Slowdive and the watery melodies of Luna, although their penchant for poppy hooks renders them more similar to Long Island's Joy Zipper than either of these. If all this parsing of influences seems a little tedious, this is apt-- Young Galaxy's polite style is itself a little tedious. Their record is as hard to get worked up about as it is easy to like. This mild tedium is most apparent on the more rock-oriented tracks, which don't play to Young Galaxy's talent for atmosphere-building and make the vocals sound generic. So despite its supernova guitars and some memorable lyrics (""You won't get out of this world alive,"" Ramsay sings with benevolent certainty), ""No Matter How Hard You Try"" doesn't make a big impression. The rockers aren't bad, but they make Young Galaxy sound interchangeable with about a million other totally fine but unexceptional indie rock bands. Ramsay and McCandless fare much better when they hew closer to classic shoegaze, with tidally lapping organs and blissful harmonies. On their best songs, they slowly build towering armatures around uplifting vocal refrains. ""Swing Your Heartache"" is excellent: Coasting in on a watery hum, it gains amplitude at a leisurely pace, soaring in a way that feels hard-earned by the end. ""The Sun's Coming Up and My Plane's Going Down"" has the same sense of expansive drift; it's spacious and billowing, orbiting its central melody rather than slamming it home with guitars. Appropriately, orbiting seems to be key for Young Galaxy-- they sound fine when they're direct, but they sound great when they're oblique, letting their melodic themes gradually unfurl via a procession of oceanic keys, saccharine harmonies, and the judicious flash of heat-lightning guitar.",Young Galaxy: Young Galaxy Album Review | Pitchfork,6.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

Their name means ""Empty Places"" in their native Tamashek language, the tongue of a people known to most of the outside world as the Tuareg. The Tuareg, who refer to themselves as the Kel Tamashek (""those who speak Tamashek"") are traditionally nomadic, occupying a vast swath of the Western Sahara that today is split between five different countries. Tinariwen formed in a refugee camp in Libya in the early 1980s; most of the members were living in exile from their homes in Mali, banished in the wake of a civil war and a wave of government repression. You could say the group, whose membership is indefinite, but generally contains about six guitarists and a few female singer/percussionists, plays a kind of desert blues, not entirely removed from the transcendent work of Ali Farka Touré. But it's not blues in the typical Westerner sense. For starters, one chord is almost always enough in this music, but more than that, the blues is present as a sense of intense longing and defiance in the face of despair that hums in sympathetic vibration with its trans-Atlantic cousin. Aman Iman is Tinariwen's third internationally released album, and it's the most powerful statement they've issued so far. It begins with guitars that conjure so much: the vast emptiness of the Sahel, the endlessness of a desert sky, the gradual shift of sands and the sudden violence of a sandstorm. ""Cler Achel"" (""I Spent the Day"") is a song for the displaced, ending with the couplet (sung in Tamashek), ""It's a time that separates the beloved from those they love/ And when you think of them, painful obsessive thoughts are all that come."" Principle vocalist Ibrahim Ag Alhabib is echoed by a chanting choir as the guitars swirl around him in hypnotic waves, oddly spectral and earthly at the same time. Tinariwen more fully embraces rock texture and volume on this album, opening ""Assouf"" (roughly, ""Longing"") with a ferocious electric guitar solo edged with wah-wah pedal and distortion. ""Matadjem Yinmixan"" (""Why All This Hate Between You?"") just rocks, clomping along on a buoyant beat that sends the guitars fluttering off on flights that John Coltrane might have admired during his post-modal phase. There's tension and release in these songs, but the crescendo and diminuendo of the music never feels calculated, flowing with an open-ended spontaneity that producer Justin Adams captures brilliantly simply by refusing to manipulate or impede it. The music of Tinariwen is at once exotic and familiar-- the scales and arrangements are as strange to our ears as the language they sing in, but there's a force operating on a more subliminal level that unites it to something rattling around inside anyone who was brought up on blues or rock & roll. It's music of longing and rebellion, weary wisdom and restless energy, and it sounds so, so good.

Between them, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Ray Price have been recording and touring for more than 150 years: Nelson made his name as a DJ and songwriter in the 1950s, when Ray was establishing his own career as a smooth crooner and Haggard was getting ready to parlay his prison experience into one of the most successful country careers of the 60s and 70s. During that time they've collaborated repeatedly, most notably on Nelson and Haggard's Pancho & Lefty in 1980 and Nelson and Price's San Antonio Rose in 1990 and Run That By Me One More Time in 2003. They're so woven into the fabric of country music and popular culture that the title Last of the Breed doesn't come off as a self-aggrandizing boast. In fact, that title might as well apply to the 22 tracks on this 2xCD set instead of the artists singing them. Besides the two new-ish compositions by Nelson and Haggard, these songs are calculable in age by decades, credited to the swinging pens of Cindy Walker, Lefty Frizzell, Floyd Tillman, Jesse Ashlock, and Harlan Howard, among others. In such company, Kris Kristofferson, represented here by ""Why Me"", counts as a young buck. These are simple, direct songs with easy melodies, witty lyrics, and true-to-life sentiments-- generally perceived to be the kind spurned by mainstream country musicians. Nashville still has its share of talented songwriters, but the myth of the good ol' days is nice and reassuring, allowing listeners to disregard contemporary country wholesale. On Last of the Breed, which accompanies a well-received joint tour with Asleep at the Wheel as their backing band, these three grizzled vets sound supremely comfortable, trading verses and songs with easy camaraderie. Even at 81, Price still sounds robust, especially on ""My Life's Been a Pleasure"", and the grizzled texture just adds seen-it-all authority to Merle's voice, especially on his new composition ""Sweet Jesus"". Willie's infamous against-the-meter phrasing has always sounded extemporaneous, as if even he doesn't know what his voice will do next; even when he slurs his lines on ""My Mary"" and ""Mom and Dad's Waltz"", he still shows an intuitively loose control that hasn't diminished with age. Their distinct voices combine gracefully on ""Sweet Memories"" and ""I Love You Because"", but they sound best on Kristofferson's ""Why Me"". That song has always seemed like a solitary prayer (especially on Johnny Cash's lonely American Recordings version), but sung by a veteran trio, it almost sounds like a career retrospective, as if they're humbled by their large audience, long legacies, and close friendship. Producer Fred Foster, returning after Nelson's 2006 Cindy Walker tribute, shows a light touch on these songs, creating a light, loping backdrop that lacks the snap of his previous work. Despite the presence of a crack backing band that includes pedal steel master Buddy Emmons and backing vocals by the Jordanaires, Last of the Breed never seems as good as it should be: there are fine versions of strong songs, but not a single definitive take. ""Lost Highway"" comes close, as do ""Heartaches by the Number"" and ""Goin' Away Party"", but most of these songs sound like the trio are trying to re-create a style long past rather anchor these songs in the here and now. That retrospective orientation is strange because none of these artists could be accused of being stuck in the past; in fact, their willingness to adapt to new styles without compromising their standards is partly what makes them the last of their breed. So it's a shame Last of the Breed isn't better-- not only do they have a lot to say about these old songs, they also have a lot to say through them.","Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Ray Price: Last of the Breed Album Review | Pitchfork",6.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
73,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10057-wire-waltz/,2007-04-05T06:00:05,['The Last Town Chorus'],Wire Waltz,"Lap steel savant Megan Hickey mines slo-mo alt-country that emphasizes sleepy atmosphere over tunes. Last Town Chorus's languid cover of David Bowie's ""Modern Love"" is the song that landed the band prominent placement during one of television's most widely watched doctor shows. Astute listeners might hear this slo-mo ""Modern Love"", think back to M. Ward's slo-mo ""Let's Dance"", and wonder: coincidence? Couldn't Last Town Chorus have dug a little, you know, deeper? Bowie's über-hit pops right out on the group's second album, Wire Waltz-- no doubt why the producers of ""Grey's Anatomy"" glommed on to it in the first place-- but that's too bad. Not for the band, of course, who surely appreciated the promotional push. It's just that the song almost single-handedly breaks the illusion Megan Hickey and her band have otherwise carefully fostered: ghostly cowboy singers floating through an urban metropolis, like America's slow, rural past seeping up from cracks in the pavement. It's also too bad that it sends people straight to Wire Waltz when it's live on stage that Last Town Chorus have built their reputation. Singer Hickey's lap steel, coated with reverb, becomes an overwhelming presence, with layers of sound rolling across her songs like an otherworldly fog. On record, however, that lap steel is merely present, less an eerie outer-space touch (as invoked by someone like Daniel Lanois) than it is a predictable alt-country accoutrement. It's not Americana that Last Town Chorus call up, though. It's singers and writers like Tanya Donnelly who have in the past used atmosphere to play up what they believe to be their attributes. In Hickey's case it's an excuse to keep her voice opiate-mellow and the songs almost skeletal in their simplicity. The weirder touches that liven up ""Caroline"", ""Wintering in Brooklyn"", and ""It's Not Over"" are subtle-- like the latter two's twisted circular guitar solos-- and mostly underscore the band's decision to stay safely within its comfort zone. And yet these songs show Hickey to be a strong writer, albeit one hampered by her adherence to a dead-end aesthetic. The nostalgia-trip ""Huntsville, 1989"" turns Hickey's perpetual wistfulness to her advantage as she recalls lost loves, listening to the Smiths at bedtime, and trying to fit in on the outside. ""Alabama, '89/ I found the kids with boots like mine,"" she sings, sounding far less precious than she could have. It's a beautiful highlight of the disc if only because very little else (aside from the Bowie) truly sticks out. Part of it may be strategic. If you make your music sleepy on purpose, that cushions complaints from listeners that it puts them to sleep. Indeed, Wire Waltz works wonderfully as a late-night salve, not so much soothing as it is negating. It's music to put on when you want to forget the world around you for a while. Unfortunately, for all its class and mystery, Wire Waltz erases itself in the process, leaving behind more a sense of mood than anything worth remembering. It's all awfully pretty, but sometimes prettiness is more potent when there's a little bit of ugly in there, too.",The Last Town Chorus: Wire Waltz Album Review | Pitchfork,6.2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
74,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10058-born-identity/,2007-04-06T06:00:05,['High Priest'],Born Identity,"Debut solo album includes production from fellow Antipop Consortium alum Earl Blaize and a brief cameo from TV on the Radio. In his breathless liner note blurb for Antipop Consortium's self-mythologizing, gallery-rap precursing 2000 debut Tragic Epilogue, Greg Tate referred to High Priest as having his ""aorta on his sleeve,"" quoting the lyric ""I'll play the part of the heart-torn rapper trying to reveal his feelings but lacking devices."" Priest's soul-searching tendencies were more often than not subsumed to the good of the Anti-Pop whole, though; in space, remember, no one can hear you scream. On his first solo record Born Identity, however, Priest makes sure the blood is flowing vigorously and unavoidably. Identity's rhythmic backdrop doesn't sound too different from the Anti-Pop records. Producer Earl Blaize is back, and his ominous piano plinks, synth blasts and skittering drum machines come with him, surrounding Priest's uniquely shapeshifting timbre-- alternately resembling MF Doom's suspended placidity and Ghostface Killah's avant-soul croon-- as well as they ever have. The beats are still fun, but Priest's overstretched, occasionally cringe-inducing lyricism is the record's breaking point. True to its title, Priest is set to establish himself as a socially conscious rapper on Identity; he's making neo-soul heavy on the ""neo"" and without traditional soul signifiers. This leads to introspective track titles like ""They Will Never See"" and ""Elevation"", the latter containing the phrase ""Can't say I never repped the hood,"" as if this record allowed him to check that off his list of career to-dos. ""Holla Atta General"" features a recurring omniscient voice intoning ""He knows just what's going down/ Expanding his consciousness to one more level,"" and ""Book of Keys"" features the eyebrow-raising boast ""I'm sorta like a young Ali, that means I'm sorta like a young Chuck D."" Ahem. That Priest is confident of his skill and place in rap's pantheon shouldn't be surprising, but it's hard not to be taken aback by Identity's constant tinfoil hat doomsday-raps, also known as unironic conspiracy theorizing. ""Pitfalls"", about returning war veterans, and ""Through the Fire"", about the government's response to Hurricane Katrina, come straight from the heart, but are pushed aside by, for instance, L.I.F.E. Long's verse on ""Karma Movements"", which imagines a post-apocalyptic America seemingly from the perspective of a crazy street corner doomsayer (yes, he does mention 12 Monkeys). On ""American Prayer"", Priest vainly tries to remember a newspaper article; you know, the one about the government injecting mind-control fluid into unsuspecting citizens. Then he wastes ""Afro Horn""s skronky jungle sax by irresponsibly conflating police-related and gang/music industry-affiliated killings: ""They shot Amadou, they shot Amaru, let's not forget they shot the son of Mrs. Wallace, too."" Priest began his career on Dan the Automator's space-rap vanity label 75 Ark, responsible for the imaginatively dystopic conceptual visions of Dr. Octagonycologist and Deltron 3030. Born Identity is most certainly cut from the same sliver lamé cloth, but suffers under the weight of Priest's ultra-serious polemics, replacing his predecessors' darkly creative humor. It feels like a missed opportunity, not least because of the wasted, nearly anonymous TV on the Radio cameo on the album-closing instrumental non-entity ""Keep Time"". If Priest is to push forward with the well-intentioned post-art school pastiche he's begun with Identity-- what Tate's blurb referred to as ""downtown avant-pop""-- he'd most definitely do well to take more than a passing glance at TVOTR's comparatively brilliant and seamless fusion.",High Priest: Born Identity Album Review | Pitchfork,4.9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For decades, Nick Cave, ringmaster of his own rock'n'roll circus, has been an unlikely paragon of routine. Not routine music, per se, but music made as part of a routine. Check in to the office, check out of the office. Repeat. Don't wait for your muse to come to you. Go to her first and demand she appear. Contrary to his reputation as a bit of a wild man, by his own account Cave's spent the past several years a man of discipline, with rules right down to what rules need be discarded, and when. Grinderman, then, is Cave's considered decision to set aside those rules and make a sideways move into the realm of stripped down-- but far from mellow-- rock. Inspired by the creation of the most recent Bad Seeds release, Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus, Cave took his cohorts Warren Ellis, Martyn Casey, and Jim Sclavunos into the studio to slash and burn their way through new ideas until they'd amassed enough for an album. Unlike Abattoir/Lyre however, Cave kept the remaining Bad Seeds on the sidelines and, rather than flesh out the results, left them raw and stinging, setting aside his piano in favor of guitar. By doing so Cave has predictably invited comparisons to his first claim to fame, the Birthday Party-- and not without reason. Grinderman reveals Cave has rediscovered (or at least reembraced) the possibilities of the theatrical punk dirge, with arrangements that threaten to fly right off the rails. But the Cave of the Birthday Party and the Cave of Grinderman are totally different beasts, and for that we can thank Cave's (yes) discipline-- as a writer, singer and as a bandleader. Grinderman are an indulgent study in excess, sure, but the twist is that at every turn Cave keeps the chaos carefully in check, emphasizing messiness when need be but also showcasing the deceptively precise playing of his band as well as his loose and at times gloriously silly lyrics. The savage and snarling Birthday Party were as stark and nihilistic as the Bad Seeds are bombastic and apocalyptic, but Cave has never fully played the role of Prince of Darkness. As a songwriter he can be scary, moving, and intense, but thankfully Cave's rarely humorless. In fact, Cave's mirthfulness is one of his enduring gifts. He's the kind of guy who'll rhyme ""Orpheus"" with ""orifice"" not just because it's clever, but also because his inner Beavis & Butthead finds it funny. Grinderman may be intended as a somewhat goofy reassertion of punk vigor and virility, but the disc is no laughing matter. ""Get It On"" starts the album in tease-mode, all build-up and no pay-off that nonetheless introduces the arsenal at hand: fuzzed out guitar, insistent rhythms, warts and all takes, oozing with animalistic sex and sleaze. The many pleasures of ""No Pussy Blues"" have been praised for months, and rightly so: The song's hilarious, with Cave's pleas for sex grower stronger and stronger until he practically creams himself with indignation when his increasingly desperate romantic overtures go roundly rebuffed. It flirts with camp, especially with its typewriter intro, but who can complain when Cave and crew are clearly having so much fun? Songs like this show why Grinderman probably wouldn't have worked as a full-fledged Bad Seeds project. It's just too concertedly unhinged, and despite the modest ranks of the reduced band there's hardly any room for anything else. The title track is a thick slab of Gothic VU blues, as perverse and insidious as any of Cave's other character pieces, its tortured guitar coda like twisting metal. ""Go Tell the Women"" proudly takes the piss as it revels in its own primitive stupidity-- it's self-parody and salacious blues tribute all in one. ""Honey Bee (Let's Fly to Mars)"" is Cave and crew's stab at a woozy, wobbly garage stomper, like many of the other Grinderman songs both a call to arms and a come-on. ""Won't somebody touch me?"" Cave demands as the world falls apart around him. The exceptions serve as little breathers, breaks from the onslaught. ""Electric Alice"" is unlucky enough to follow ""No Pussy Blues"", so it would probably sound like a throw-away experiment in psychedelic loops and textures even it weren't a throw-away experiment in psychedelic loops and textures. The measured soul of ""(I Don't Need You to) Set Me Free"" and the familiar melodrama of ""Man in the Moon"" and ""When My Love Comes Down"" are prime Cave, but each marks a slight deviation from the Grinderman aesthetic. They're just a little too classy, too neat, despite the roaring undercurrent of musical violence in the last, which picks up right before the song cuts off. That leaves the somewhat anticlimactic ""Love Bomb"", nonetheless a much better approximation of the death of the 60s fin de siecle vibe than anything on the embarrassing Stooges reunion disc. Yes, the lyrics split the difference between 21st century Doors portent and Iggy's own current pop-culture citing missteps. The difference is that Cave's winking delivery implies he recognizes that dumb is just a state of mind, and he's more than willing to subsume his smarts for the sake of the music. By taking one for the team and donning a Stooge-worthy dunce cap, Cave in turn gives us so much more, and frees up is Id to wreak glorious havoc.",Grinderman: Grinderman Album Review | Pitchfork,7.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
76,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10060-red-gone-wild/,2007-04-05T06:00:04,['Redman'],Red Gone Wild,"The id-driven hip-hop vet's long-delayed follow up to 2001's disappointing Malpractice finds him continuing to work with old friends like Method Man, Erick Sermon, and Biz Markie. Redman hasn't been popping up in guest-rapper rotations nearly as often as he once did, but when he does, the effect remains the same. On tracks like Beanie Sigel's ""One Shot Deal"" and Ghostface's ""Greedy Bitches"", he blasts in like a hurricane, throwing punchlines haphazardly in all directions and cutting through all the hard exteriors around him with his id-driven insanity. It's the role he's played for more than 15 years, ever since he first came to prominence as a member of EPMD's Hit Squad. During New York hip-hop's late-90s jiggy era, he could deflate the self-seriousness of the rappers around him with a single uproarious non sequitur; I'll always fondly remember the episode of ""MTV Cribs"" where he showed off his bombed-out crash-pad in all its disgusting glory. Red's released six solo albums since 1992. Every one of them is inconsistent and overlong, but all of them boast more than enough moments of delirious anarchy to redeem any excesses. Even Malpractice, his justly maligned 2001 album, had the sublimely dumb ""Smash Sumthin'"" working for it. Red Gone Wild, his first new album since Malpractice, is only now seeing the light of day after years of delays. So it's hard not to greet it with a mixture of relief and dread. As great as it is to see Red releasing new material, the album feels like it's been sitting in a vault somewhere since 1998, and there's something profoundly depressing about that. On one hand, Red's consistency is admirable. He's still working with the same gang of knuckleheads, even if the commercial rap world has long passed them by. Longtime producer Rockwilder turns in a few tracks, as does mentor Erick Sermon. ""Walk in Gutta"" reunites Red with his Def Squad crew, even making sure to include part-time member Biz Markie, and Method Man shows up on ""Blow Treez"". Characters from past albums' skits return. Also still evident: Red's endless, cartoonish appetite for weed, nasty sex, and borderline-nonsensical jokes: ""For that paper, I'm offending neighbors/ Running my label out of old Winnebago."" But honestly, Red Gone Wild wouldn't have worked even in 1998. The album doesn't have any of the euphorically propulsive standout tracks that held Redman's older albums together. The first single, the propulsive Timbaland-produced club-track ""Put It Down"", comes closest, but none of Red's lines quite find their mark. Throughout the record, Red continues to manically spill nutty, energetic nonsense over clunky, dated keyboard-driven tracks, and it almost feels as though Red's afraid to push himself outside his comfort zone and try anything else. Even his pop-culture references are dated: Joe Piscopo, Teena Marie, Rodney Dangerfield's Back to School, ""getting head on my couch from a chick that resemble Rosie Perez in the mouth."" It's as if weed has kept him from remembering anything he's seen on TV since 1989. Redman also wastes prodigious album-time on his thoroughly undistinguished Gilla House crew, all of whom either unsuccessfully ape Red's blown-out comedy or offer up the sort of oppressively boring straight-faced thug boilerplate that Red always avoided himself. Even without those Gilla House appearances, though, Red Gone Wild only comes alive in quick, tantalizing bursts, never cohering into a whole or even convincingly evoking past glories. And that's a shame; Redman is way too lively a rapper to put his name on a product as anemic as this. If there's any justice in the world, Def Jam won't force him to wait six years before he gets another shot.",Redman: Red Gone Wild Album Review | Pitchfork,5.5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
77,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10061-shock-value/,2007-04-02T06:00:01,['Timbaland'],Shock Value,"Timbaland's equivalent of the Neptunes' Clones LP features guest spots from Justin Timberlake (on three tracks), Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, Nelly Furtado, and Missy Elliott. And then there's the rock bands: Fall Out Boy, The Hives, and She Wants Revenge. And then there's Elton John. And Magoo.  : / When it comes down to the big three producer-MCs who have defined club-friendly rap over the past decade-- Diddy, Pharrell and Timbaland-- Tim's the one who's been best able to rein in his self-indulgent tendencies. He hasn't spent more time being a pop icon than a musician, hasn't suffered from any major dry spells of creative entropy and, most importantly, has known enough to let his beats do most of the heavy lifting. This might be one of the reasons he's considered by most trainspotter pop fiends to be more of a genius than those other two; even when Tim runs his mouth, it's typically been innocuously catchy-- even complementary-- enough to keep the production's strengths at the forefront. The other main factor in his genius, as anyone who's had a radio on at any point in the last decade knows, is his ability to integrate unexpected niche-genre sonics most hip hop and R&B producers wouldn't steer towards-- bhangra, jungle, trance-- and use them for a kind of universal club futurism that, since it fits well in damn near every place people dance, makes for an easy route to chart and cultural dominance. When Tim's shit goes wrong, though, it's harder to get to the root of the problem. His recent bodybuilding obsession, his divisive, grandstanding mini-sets during the Justin Timberlake tour, and his forehead-smack of a beef with Scott Storch (?)(!) have made for great blog-snark gossip fodder, but they don't necessarily signal any kind of creative decline, especially after the juggernaut year he had in '06. But while solo Timbaland's always been a mixed bag, Timbaland Presents Shock Value is more mediocre than it has any right to be, filled with overreaching pretense and phoned-in vacancy-- either trying too hard, or not hard enough. Almost everything potentially great and really wrong about Shock Value is exhibited in leadoff track ""Oh Timbaland"". The beat's built on the same piano hook (from Nina Simone's ""Sinnerman"") that Kanye West pillaged for Talib Kweli's ""Get By""-- he's just made it more manic, releasing some Dirty South tension with Shaq-hand-sized claps and Catfish Collins chicken-scratch guitar. It's a hell of a way to start things off, even assuming you don't care that a song about a man futilely trying to escape his transgressions is being appropriated so Tim can issue death threats and brag about his private planes. Simone's reconstructed voice is a sinister hook (""Oh Timbaland, where you gonna run to?""), and Tim's answer to this haunting, retribution-of-God threat (a quickly tossed-off ""nowhere""), is a sign of the hubris to follow. Not that Tim half-asses anything on the production end. The first two-thirds of the album are front-loaded with the kind of futuristic club beats his rep rests on, and some of them-- the berserk Bootsy-meets-Thomas Dolby-by-way-of-Basement Jaxx house-funk of ""Release"" and the ""The Way I Are"", which sounds like ""Push It"" gone trance-- are straight-up jaw-droppers. But the record's also plagued with some of the most empty, dead-eyed, joyless lyrics to hit the clubs in a while. Tim's on-record persona has soured drastically in the last few years, trading in the relaxed party-rocker's swagger of Tim's Bio and Indecent Proposal for a tensed-up, violent defensiveness. Where he used to be all about shaking off haters and basking contentedly in his wealth, he seems a lot more obsessed now with maintaining a shaky thug cred and using his status as a bludgeon. ""I know shit ain't sweet, so the shit get deep/ I'm rich, I can pay to have you six feet deep,"" he mutters lifelessly on ""Come and Get Me"", while the petulant hostility of ""Kill Yourself"" culminates in a chorus (""Go on, kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself/ If I was you I wouldn't feel myself"") that feels like the Dew-fueled frothing of a 14-year-old caught up in an anime message board flamewar. Even his turn on the hilarious failure of a strip-club jam ""Bounce"" (as in ""...like your ass has the hiccups"") is riddled with death threats and gun talk; at least guest rapper Dr. Dre-- who, admittedly, resorts to terrible Chinese-name double-entendres (""Sum Yung Ho"") and rhyming ""ain't this money handsome"" with ""ain't this a panty anthem""-- remembers it's a track about fucking. In this context, rife with fuck-you-haters self-consciousness and obnoxious posturing, even the guest roster on this album feels like it's caught up in a lazy arrogance. Justin Timberlake shows up on three tracks, first offering more of the usual Prince-baiting on lead single ""Give It to Me"", and then some ecstatic harmonies on ""Release"", which are great when you can hear them under Tim's atonal half-sung bellowing. (This same atonal half-sung bellowing overextends its welcome on almost every non-rap track, by the way.) Unfortunately, his dopey ""you on me and me on you and you on her"" traffic control on ""Bounce"" marks one of the album's most slack-jaw stupid moments. Aside from a freaky-as-hell Missy, pretty much every guest rapper-- from 50 and Tony Yayo to Attitude and D.O.E.-- rhyme like they didn't have to pay half a mil to get their spot on the track. (Jay-Z and Kanye were supposed to be on the album, but missed the deadline-- aw, don't be sad, there's a Magoo appearance!) Then there's the much-touted rock collaborations, which either fail to play to the bands' strengths (the Hives' Howlin' Pelle Almqvist-- backup singer?) or prove why Timbaland is still a hell of a lot more interesting than most modern rock in the first place. The only thing more cringeworthy than the first time Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump screams a simpering ""wipe that smi-hul off your fucking fayyyyce"" in ""One & Only"" is the eighth time-- though the line ""Be my unholy, my one and my lonely"" is a pretty strong contender. And the last track, ""2 Man Show"", features Tim admonishing Elton John for coming in too early with the piano, then spends the rest of the track talking about how great the song actually is rather than just proving it. Like almost every other lyric on the album, it's all a conceited bluff. So Timbaland spends an hour on the wrong side of the ""ft."", fans wind up cringing for a while, and then we suddenly remember he's doing the Björk album and we get geeked again. As bad as this album is, it's not offensive enough to worry about for too long; if its contents were split up into 17 singles and B-sides and one-shots and scattered across the charts for 15 months, it'd hardly be worth worrying about. It's just that it's disconcerting sometimes to be confronted with an entire album's worth of evidence that geniuses can fuck up, just like everyone else.",Timbaland: Shock Value Album Review | Pitchfork,4.1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
78,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10062-time-taunts-me/,2007-04-06T06:00:04,['Lost in the Trees'],Time Taunts Me,"Ari Picker (the Never)'s first release as Lost in the Trees is orchestral and ambitious, as he builds his songs from contrasting sections and maintains consistent sonic themes across the breadth of the record. Ambition runs high on Ari Picker's first record as Lost in the Trees, a brief but intensely lush collection of seven songs that last just 26 minutes yet still feels like a full-length album. Picker's projects all seem to have something big about them-- he's also in a band called the Never, who last year released an album called Antarctica that came with a full-color picture book illustrated by bandmate Noah Smith. On this one, the big things are the orchestrations. Though he's only working with a small group of musicians, including a string quartet, the final product sounds a lot larger, mostly thanks to studio trickery. Opener ""Lost in the Snow"" begins with fractured programming soon joined by sweeping strings and a choral countermelody that's likely sampled or sequenced. It's a huge, ear-grabbing intro for a song that, once the vocals come in, is itself almost impossibly tiny-- just Picker's gentle tenor dueting with Jessica Smith's jazzy bass trombone. The vocal section almost feels like an interlude for the symphonic grandeur that surrounds it, and the coda returns the strings back before pulling away for a piano that embodies the winter theme of the lyrics. The album isn't mixed continuously, but it has the feel of a suite because of the way Picker builds his songs from contrasting sections and keeps the sound consistent across the record. Consistency can work against an album, of course, but Picker gets around this by introducing alien textures into the sound at strategic points that immediately stand out for their otherness. For instance, ""Tall Trees"" kicks in with woodwinds riding a brisk, clipped beat, and then pulls the strings in around it, with a funky cello part underlying a very Vivaldi composition for the other strings. The woodwind texture flows into the next song, ""I've Always Loved the Fall"", which in turn splits open the center of the album (and its own pastoral atmosphere) with a decidedly ungodly church organ passage. There are a lot of influences at play here. ""If You're Afraid of the Dark"" is basically an ornate folk tune, replete with beautiful male/female harmonies, while ""For Elizabeth & John"" could've wandered from a Carter Burwell or Mark Mothersbaugh score. Looking at the cover art, it seems pretty clear Kid A's had at least a few spins in Picker's house, and you can hear the influence here and there in the electro-acoustic mix. Picker's ambition mostly pays off on Time Taunts Me, a very promising debut that seems stuffed with ideas. Picker has the talent, clearly-- his biggest shortcoming at this point is that his arrangements are often more memorable than the vocal meat of his songs. Even so, that's as much a reflection on how sharp those arrangements are as anything else, and this is ultimately a solid collection of orchestral indie pop from a guy with the potential to be very good indeed.",Lost in the Trees: Time Taunts Me Album Review | Pitchfork,7.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
79,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10063-soft-skeletons/,2007-04-03T05:00:03,['Call Me Lightning'],Soft Skeletons,"Frenchkiss band offers an album about death and dying, a morose focus at odds with the band's raucous garage-punk. One of my musical pet peeves is the incompatibility of punk rock and its cousin subgenres with anything that smells of a concept album. It's almost as if the mere act of thinking through one's music enough to create a cohesive album-length concept, be it as simple as a thematic focus or as complex as a narrative structure, is a crime of pretension severe enough to cut one's punk membership card in half. This line of thinking ignores the fact that punk was essentially built upon fictional premises, the idea of band-as-outlaw perpetuated by the Clash or the Ramones, not to mention the more obvious conceptual themes groups like the Misfits or the Descendents used to drive their respective aesthetics. Fortunately, a few modern bands are similarly dismissive of this inaccuracy, from the straightforward, sci-fi editorializing approach of the Thermals to the farther-out-there concepts that Liars use to organize their experiments. Soft Skeletons indicates that Call Me Lightning are another band unafraid of thematic consistency, as it features several songs dealing with, well, skeletons. But bony ghouls are just the album's most persistent symbol; in a larger sense, Soft Skeletons is an album about death and dying, a morose focus at odds with the band's raucous garage-punk. It's not an entirely discordant clash of sound and message; with their cartoonish seizure guitars and video-game basslines, the band sounds like they're playing endless punk-rock variations on the Tales From the Crypt theme or the Danny Elfman score for a Tim Burton movie. Appropriate then to be talking about shattered tombs (""Billion Eyes"") or describing post-death biological processes from the point of view of the corpse (""Beaming Streaks""), as if Call Me Lightning were crafting a rock'n'roll tribute to EC Comics. However, for such an approach, a certain level of acting chops are required from the singer, as it's easier to swallow songs about zombies and hauntings when delivered with the B-movie affectations of a Glenn Danzig or Nick Cave. Call Me Lightning's Nathan Lilley chooses instead to go the vocal-cord ripping route, yelling and screeching over the din of his band and sacrificing any kind of creepy subtlety in the process. His limitations show on tracks both fast (the Advantage-like ""Nobody Dies"") and slow (the brooding ""Filthy Information""), while the vocal melodies (and the shoutalong backings) frequently lose out to the playful and tuneful runs of the guitar/bass interplay. Call Me Lightning aspire to be a Milwaukee spin on the snide throwback Pixies-punk of Mclusky, but whether due to lack of Welsh accent or a less sharp sense of humor, Soft Skeletons never quite gets there. Sure, songs like ""Bottles and Bottles"" or ""Shadow Twin"", at least instrumentally, generate a novel spin on the familiar moves of spastic post-punk Frenchkiss acts. But too many stumbles and failures of execution keep the record from being much more than a noble attempt at reconciling punk with its conceptual roots, leaving an attempt at horror-punk that doesn't succeed at being even marginally scary or particularly memorable.",Call Me Lightning: Soft Skeletons Album Review | Pitchfork,5.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The vanishing-point music created by drone elders Phil Niblock and, especially, LaMonte Young is what happens when a fixation on held tones reaches a tipping point. Timbre is reduced to either a single clear instrument or a sine wave, silence disappears completely, and the base-level interaction between small clusters of ""pure"" tone becomes the music's content. This kind of work takes what typically helps us to distinguish ""music"" from ""sound,"" discards nearly all of it, and then starts over again from scratch. Drone legends Stars of the Lid find their music drifting toward this rarefied place on their first album after an almost six-year absence. On first listen, And Their Refinement of the Decline seems a continuation of its beloved precursor, 2001's The Tired Sounds of... It is again a double CD with about two hours of music; it uses a similar palette of violin, cello, and Stuart Dempster-inspired horns to augment the electronically generated drones. Song titles again refer to brain chemistry (""Dopamine Clouds Over Craven Cottage""), altered states (""Another Ballad for Heavy Lids""), and the nuts and bolts of the music's creation (Apreludes (in C sharp major)""). And yet, upon putting on Tired Sounds of... again for comparison, I see Adam Wiltzie and Brian McBride have actually come some distance in the last half-decade. And the place they're moving to is starker, quieter, somehow even more subtle, where the tiniest amount of sound information is put upon to do the greatest amount of work. Where Tired Sounds of... sounded genteel and stately next to the raw four-track feedback fests they'd started with (""Tape Hiss Makes Me Happy"" summed up their debut nicely), it now sounds about halfway between their genesis and this album; ""refinement"" turns out to be the perfect word. The first thing that becomes apparent is that there's less discernible guitar here. The acoustic instruments once served as foils to the channeled electricity, but now they've taken center stage, and the horns and strings are often used in a curious way. Rather than being stretched out to push against silence with drone music proper, on tracks like ""Dungtitled (in A Major)"" and ""The Evil that Never Arrived"", flugelhorn, cello, and violin are used in short, slowly decaying bursts, keeping skeletal tunes aloft by bumping them with a chord every few seconds. The added space between the notes makes the pieces seem less forward and pervasive, like they might vanish into the air at any moment. It also cuts the drama and leaves the music more open to interpretation. While SOTL will always be tagged as ""cinematic,"" the music here rarely leads. You get the sense that this it could be used to color a wide array of images. The brief ""Hiberner Toujours"" on the second disc is a three-note phrase played on a cello with an intense vibrato and heavy reverb, first alone, then doubled, with muted electronic treatments lurking just behind. I could just as easily see it soundtracking a morning-after newsreel of a WWII firebombing or a stop-motion blooming of a flower. And then ""Humectez La Mouture"" extends an idea developed by the sorely missed Labradford and perfected by the Books: A deceptively simple and spacious bit of music with a neutral emotional cast is presented without additional cues and allowed to live or die on its own. Here SOTL take a couple of piano chords lightly kissed with electronics and let the progression play with small bits of shading, including what sounds like manipulated pedal steel and the dialog track from a French film. It doesn't ""go"" anywhere, really, and it's hard to say what it projects; the music could be crushingly sad, lightly melancholic, or even uplifting, depending on the state of mind of the hearer. It becomes a sound divorced from intention and its ambiguity is its strength. This stripping down and moving away from easily definable mood makes And Their Refinement of the Decline a bit harder to grasp initially than any previous SOTL record. The less pronounced changes and more sparing use of dynamic range means that the music can easily slip into the background when something else requires attention. That's par for the course with ambient music, of course, but I get the sense this music is shortchanged by being functional. There's too much focus on the careful layering of sounds, and too many small but still important tweaks happening from moment to moment to let everything slide by in an undifferentiated blob of sound. It's the rare moment when SOTL tip their hand and let more expressionistic feelings seep into the music that you understand how well the album works as a whole. The brilliant ""Even if You're Never Awake (Deuxième)"" is one such place, as its surges of strings are gradually cut with curled shavings of backward guitar, and some almost sub-sonic bass halfway through its 9 minutes announces an even wearier turn into the lament's final section. It ""develops"" in the conventional sense, as does ""December Hunting for Vegetarian Fuckface"", the album's final track. After almost two hours we arrive at perhaps the most playful title ever from a band known for playful titles, and also what could be SOTL's defining statement. ""December Hunting"" is like the band's entire history playing out in a single piece, all the tensions in their music-- acoustic vs. electric, cryptic vs. obvious, joyous vs. sorrowful-- are articulated and probed in 17 heavenly minutes of drone without a tedious moment. It's the final and greatest example of that special thing that happens, with all due respect to their fine solo material, only when these two get together.",Stars of the Lid: And Their Refinement of the Decline Album Review | Pitchfork,8.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
81,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10065-remixed-covered/,2007-04-05T06:00:01,['Xiu Xiu'],Remixed & Covered,"This 2xCD set is, as the title suggests, split between remixes and covers of Jaime Stewart's theatrical electro-pop group's music, and it features contributions from Devendra Banhart, Sunset Rubdown, Marissa Nadler, Why?, and Kid606. Music's impetus is much more complicated within a commercial framework than a traditional folk one, but one of its original functions-- to convey a heritage across time-- remains intact. The best evidence for this is how consistently the emergence of new tools for manipulating sound has been accompanied by a rush to standardize their use. John Cage noted that as soon as the theremin was invented, people started trying to replicate chamber music with it. A minority of guitarists explore the instrument's range of possibility; more crowd into the narrow province of rock. Software that has the potential to expand sound palettes is more often used in the service of conformity, rendering the mistake all but obsolete. Those who choose to intone outside the lines are free to do so; but it's natural for the majority to work within genre restraints and it's interesting to see how the collective negotiation toward a standard unfolds, especially with the remix, which is still new enough for us to watch it happen in real time. The remix isn't determined by technology to any greater degree than other genres, but its tendencies sure can make it seem that way. When you think ""remix,"" despite the endless possibilities for rearranging sound, don't you immediately think ""dance?"" As such, the remix disc that comprises half of this encomium to Xiu Xiu's theatrical electro-pop is about what you'd expect: Mostly Xiu Xiu songs with more intricate drum patterns, glitchier melodies, and rushing synths. Not that the results can't be nice: Kid 606's thin-sliced version of ""Bishop, CA"" is masterfully dynamic. Gold Chains fashions ""Hello from Eau Claire"" into an itchy electro banger in the vein of Vitalic, recasting Caralee McElroy as an anomic club diva. This Song Is a Mess But So Am I does the exact same thing with ""Buzz Saw"". Son's ""Over Over"" opens with squalls that promise a harsh noise overhaul, but nope-- red herring; more gleaming beats. Xiu Xiu themselves gussy up ""Ceremony"" into a new wave jet crash, and To Live and Shave in L.A. trawl through the entirety of The Air Force to craft a dizzying IDM collage. If these efforts feel familiar, it's easy to understand why-- the beat-oriented remix is a proven formula for delivering thrills and chills, and the artists here who venture outside of it do so with mixed results. Warbucks' ""Suha"" is a tense piano ballad that actually pulls more resonance from Jamie Stewart's voice than the original's sputtering electro. Grouper stretches ""Tonite & Today"" into the long, wispy drones they favor; one wonders if it would've been a better fit for the covers disc. The only outright dud is Cherry Point's ""Ale"", which simply pickles the song into a brine of distortion that's neither monstrous enough to be of interest on its own nor subtle enough to strike a compelling contrast to the source material. So the remix disc is pretty much just a shine job, but the superior covers disc is packed with surprises and interesting mutations; it has a stylistic broadness that's understandably absent from its companion. Part of its success stems from prudent artist choices-- Xiu Xiu collaborators like Larsen and Oxbow understand his idiom well enough to make it their own. The former plays ""Mousey Toy"" as bright, majestic post-rock with computer-generated vocals; the latter absorbs ""Saturn"" into his haunting, harrowing outsider-folk style. But beyond being enjoyable, the covers disc actually reveals something true about Xiu Xiu-- they aren't really, despite all the screaming and strident noises and ranting set pieces, experimental musicians. They aren't doing anything to music that scans as unnatural to Western listening habits. They're more like very, very idiosyncratic pop musicians, setting about the codification of their own superficially anarchic sound. If Xiu Xiu songs weren't rooted in pop, it wouldn't have been possible for Marisa Nadler to so seamlessly transform ""Clowne Towne"" into a folky hymn while retaining such a strong sense of the original, or for Sunset Rubdown to faithfully reproduce ""Apistat Commander"" in their own cosmic arena rock style. (Granted, it probably still would have been possible for Devendra Banhart to make ""Support Our Troops"" into a sort of mystical doo-wop, but that's just what he does.) Not all the covers hit the bullseye: The flimsiness of Her Space Holiday's piano-pop version of ""I Luv the Valley OH!"" is emphasized by the original's brawn, and Why?'s digital post-country doesn't do ""The Wig Master"" any favors. But they do draw out the immaculate melodic structures that lurk in the howling depths of most Xiu Xiu songs, coloring our perception of them like colored gels, while the remix disc is mostly strobe lights and smoke machines.",Xiu Xiu: Remixed & Covered Album Review | Pitchfork,7.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
82,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10066-the-abbatoir-blues-tour/,2007-04-03T05:00:01,['Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds'],The Abbatoir Blues Tour,"This powerful band's 2xCD/2xDVD live set showcases two sides of the group-- one hard and harsh, the other more sentimental. Nick Cave turns 50 this year, and with his receding hairline and even gaunter appearance of late, he could easily settle into his rock twilight years, wherein the edginess of his career-making early work is smoothed over for a mature AOR radio-friendly sound. In fact, his decision to employ a gospel choir on his 2004 double album, Abbatoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus, might have been a step toward adult contemporary schmaltz, were it not for the album's psychotic meditations on artistic inspiration and good-versus-evil. The one-time shitkicking Birthday Party singer and rabble-rousing Bad Seeds frontman may have refined his attack, but even as his musical range has expanded, his subject matter remains visceral without being gratuitous and intelligent without being academic. Balancing vulgarity with suavity (the man looks good in a suit), he's turning expectations of middle age inside out, making a mockery of all the gone-soft musicians who have fortressed themselves against obsolescence with standards albums and reunion tours. So, every time you play Cave's new double-live 2xCD/2xDVD set, a little part of Sting dies. That alone should be enough to keep it in constant rotation, but The Abbatoir Blues Tour is actually a solid entry in Cave's canon, one of too few live releases from the brooding bard, perhaps even besting the so-so Live Seeds from 1993, which has several tracks in common. Abbatoir/Orpheus was a particularly strong album, one that made good use of its double-disc sprawl and filled every song with intriguing musical and thematic ideas. If at times this even bigger set seems a little redundant of its studio predecessor, it's fascinating to see how Cave and his coterie have adapted these ideas to the stage and how new songs sit alongside earlier material like ""The Weeping Song"", ""Deanna"", and ""Stagger Lee"", which noisily disembowels the American blues legend. Between this set, the upcoming badassathon of his side project Grinderman, and his screenplay for last year's Aussie epic The Proposition, Cave still has fire in his belly. Shot to suggest the dynamic of a barfight, the two DVDs-- recorded at London's Brixton Academy and Hammersmith Apollo-- emphasize the physicality of the Bad Seeds' performance, specifically the concentration with which each member contributes to the larger sound. Halfway through each lead track, they're already soaked in sweat-- all except Cave, despite his jet-black suit and manic Elvis swagger. I suppose the lights of a London stage can't compare with the intensity of the fires of hell. As on the studio albums, the backing singers mock, taunt, curse, and defy Cave, his characters, and even the audience, adding slick retorts to ""Stagger Lee"" and genuinely gorgeous uplift to ""O Children"". On the other hand, the music seems all the more potent for having a live audience present during its creation. That shouldn't be surprising, considering that Cave has always played the part of a preacher and invested his songs with a sort of rapturous conviction. In this case, singing along to ""Red Right Hand"", apparently a crowd favorite, would seem to be the equivalent of speaking in tongues. Like Abbatoir/Orpheus, these two DVDs showcase two sides of the band: the Brixton disc features harder, harsher Abbatoir songs like ""Get Ready for Love"" and ""There She Goes, My Beautiful World"", while the much shorter, somewhat anticlimactic Hammersmith set echoes the softer, more balladlike Orpheus, with songs like ""Nobody's Baby Now"" and ""Wonderful Life"" (albeit not a single song from either Abbatoir or Orpheus). Of course, there are no tidy categorizations: the Birthday Party-era ""Wild World"" begins quietly, with Cave at his piano, but erupts into a show-closing din. Warren Ellis' flute set begins ""Nature Boy"" softly, even sweetly, but quickly becomes dissonant racket, and ""Red Right Hand"" veers wildly between a lovely guitar/piano duet and abrupt bursts of abrasive noise. The backing singers goad the skronk of ""Stagger Lee"", lending it the staginess of a showtune, which makes the imagery all the more visceral. The infernal dread of ""Red Right Hand"", the vulgar theatrics of ""Stagger Lee"", and the hoary pastoral of ""Breathless"" don't merely cohabitate here, but feed off one another to create a beautiful grotesquerie and reveal the breadth of the band's endeavors.",Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds: The Abbatoir Blues Tour Album Review | Pitchfork,7.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It's hard not to notice the Chalets' elaborately conceived packaging. The Dublin boy/girl quintet's leading ladies, singer/keyboardists Caiomhe ""Pony"" Derwin and Paula ""Pee Pee"" Cullen, make their own playful costumes. Their album artwork is airplane-themed, down to a pair of aviator sunglasses dangling from the pilot's shirt pocket that doubles as lyric sheet holder. Most rock's post-Nevermind austerity notwithstanding, stage presentations and album covers have long made up a meaningful part of pop fanhood. The songs should still come first. The Chalets remember this guideline only infrequently on their debut album, Check In, which finally arrives on these shores nearly two years after receiving generally glowing notices abroad. The band's chunky guitar pop and shrill electro-punk does leave a short-lived sugar buzz now and then, but it often relies on heavy-handed writing about a stereotyped battle of the sexes. Yeah, kinda like that new sitcom on CBS. Or, more frequently, Grease. Several tracks on Check In vie unsuccessfully to displace 1998's ""Grease Megamix"" as the most popular boy/girl karaoke song no boy ever picks. ""You're making us wanna unbuckle our trousers,"" the Chalets guys hoot over muted power chords on silly opener ""Theme from Chalets"", as the gals retort in cutesy B-52s harmony, ""You're making us wanna tighten our skirts."" The song's hook bears an uncanny resemblance to the one from Smash Mouth's ""Walkin' on the Sun"". On ""Love Punch"", the sexes fight it out with rape jokes and Presets-like synths, while ""Two Chord Song"" sees the lads joining a band with the ladies-- they quickly become vapid one-hit video stars. Not that easy, is it? Check In shows the most promise when the Chalets' male and female members all sing together, rather than apart. Simple new wave tune ""No Style"" achieves a California glow that helps more Mars v. Venus lyrics about ""staring at her ass"" pass as witty. To be sure, only a thin line separates this track or oddball hookup thriller ""Nightrocker"" from more mediocre singles like the chugging ""Sexy Mistake"". Thing is, for all the focus on concept, the songs here frequently wind up sounding commercial-jingley rather than catchy, with lyrics more unremarkable than universal (""Everybody wants to feel the machine/ Everybody, yeah, you know what I mean"").

Slipping into the Paul Epworth-produced post-wave sweepstakes after the Futureheads and Bloc Party, Maxïmo Park were underdogs from the get go. But instead of being spit out by a populace growing bored with gung-ho rhythms and the word ""angular,"" the Newcastle quintet more than held their own with 2005's A Certain Trigger, a burst of treble-rock so taut it made Franz Ferdinand sound Funkadelic. Now, with their competition slumping slightly, there's an opportunity for Maxïmo Park to start setting trends themselves. Did they take advantage? Well...no. Much like their cohorts, the group strives for grander statements with their sophomore album by enlisting a mainstream producer and offering-up more midtempo fare. In comparison, it makes their debut LP come off like a youthful demo. And-- much like their cohorts-- some of the band's winsome scrappiness is lost in transition. Compressed into a rumbling guitar-rock fastball, A Certain Trigger was marked by Epworth's zoomed-in production. Along with its hairpin songwriting, that record captured a one-take candidness-- you could hear bug-eyed lead singer Paul Smith deliberately inhale before rattling off a manic melody at the top of ""Now I'm All Over the Shop"". Our Earthly Pleasures' sound is more calculating and broad-- and it clashes with the band's spitfire inclinations. A catalyst behind this change is producer Gil Norton, who worked the boards on the Pixies' 1989 classic Doolittle and, more recently, eponymous albums from Ben Kweller and Morningwood. Although Smith claims, ""The gaps between words are the things that really intrigue me/ It's the gasps and the sighs that say more about what's inside you,"" on opener ""Girls Who Play Guitars,"" such incidental sonic perks are largely excised in favor of a more commercial, gap-less sheen. Whereas lesser tracks on A Certain Trigger were rendered passable partially thanks to Epworth's condensed attack, Our Earth Pleasures duds like ""Your Urge"" (which introduces itself with Billy Joel-style piano flourishes) and normalized modern rocker ""Sandblasted and Set Free"" are done-in by the record's spic-and-span treatment. Even when the new style seems to work, as on the Devo-meets-Nirvana first single ""Our Velocity"", recent live versions of the song-- including one on ""Top of the Pops""-- blow away the recorded take. Questionable studio decisions aside, Maxïmo Park have at least one distinct advantage over their Brit brethren: the desperate intensity of howler Paul Smith. His guileless Geordie accent intact, Smith may be the most likeable frontman among his immediate contemporaries (sorry, Kele). He's traded-in the signature comb-over for a sharp bowler hat, but the spastic singer is still neurotically consumed by unfulfilling relationships. On early single ""Apply More Pressure"", he sang, ""I hope that I will live to see you undress,"" to a potential partner. But now that he's seen her naked, it seems, she's gone away. From the ominous unpacking tale ""Books From Boxes"" (""You have to leave, I appreciate that/ But I hate when conversation slips out of our grasp"") to the anxious aftermath of ""By the Monument"" (""Posterity has hold of us now/ Am I just waiting for the next chapter?"") to the Before Sunset nostalgia of ""Parisian Skies"" (""I don't think she knew how much I loved her""), Smith chronicles a particularly harsh long-distance split in a style that's part Stipe-ian oblique and part emo confessional. He's prone to the occasional distracting Word of the Day (""I wonder how we tessellate/ It would have been much wiser to allow these feelings to abate,"" he enunciates on ""Your Urge"") and his flashes of Cocker-style wit come too few and far between, but the singer finds an affecting comfort zone somewhere between sentimental and nonsensical. And while the optimistic stand-out ""A Fortnight's Time"" veers from Pleasures' sad script, the hook is a winning example of Smith's quirky expertise: ""Would you like to go on a date with me?/ And I know it's old-fashioned to say so/ Five time five equals twenty-five/ Don't you know your times tables by now?"" (He may or may not be hitting on a third grader.) One of the greatest legacies of the original post-punk-meets-new-wave bands were their stylistic diversity; groups like XTC, Talking Heads, and Devo were not only distinct from each other, but they thrived on pushing their respective sounds into unpredictable territory. So the fact that the era's apparent ancestors are largely repeating themselves or evolving in the same traditionally commercial, ""serious"" direction is slightly disheartening. Maxïmo Park's first album featured a hazy, spoken-word anomaly called ""Acrobat"" that sounded like nothing else on the LP. The song was ballsy and beautiful, and it hinted at an untapped adventurousness. There's nothing like ""Acrobat"" on Our Earthly Pleasures.

By this point in Dr. Dog's career, one can only assume that 1960s pop is so deeply embedded in the neural connectors of their collective brain that it's unwittingly marred the band's seven-year career. The group's latest record, We All Belong, is another collection of impressionistic déjà-vus-- easy guitar melodies and predictable rhythms thrust at us with no discernible amount of self-awareness. Dr. Dog are due applause for putting on a good live show, where they showcase their throwback sound with flair, but that energy and charm doesn't frequently translate to their recorded content. The title track goes so far as to sound like a discarded Beatles track, complete with George Harrison's crackly, jarring guitar, Ringo Starr's dramatic, ear-boxing drums, distant ooh-wah vocal harmonies, and a Paul McCartney whine of a chorus. Except would the Beatles ever bring us a lyric as odious as ""We all belong""? (With ""All You Need Is Love"" they came close.) Elsewhere, ""My Old Ways"", fun track that it is, flits between the trebly vocals of the Shout Out Louds to the simple piano dalliances of Menomena's first album, but without either's more addictive qualities. Playful harmonies in the song's final minutes are subtly jarring and a departure from the strong, leaden, and pretty polyphonies of the Fab Four. ""The Way the Lazy Do"" affords us more of the messy, buzzing electric guitars popular in contemporary indie rock: the climbing, sadly triumphant chorus tricks us into thinking the melody will resolve, but the screeching keyboards keep it languorous and jarring until the close. The tiny, joyous blues throwback ""Die, Die, Die"" captures our attention with a hyperbolic narrative about smoking, and here the vocals take on the humanistic, nakedly emotional delivery of a singer like Man Man's Honus Honus. ""Alaska"" is another more successful turn, as twinkling yet robust guitars mimic howling, porous, unintelligible vocals. If the influences are too glaring and the melodies too circuitous, Dr. Dog at least manages to sandwich heartfelt messages between their fleeting moments of originality, like the neat chaos of whistles and percussion in the dying minutes of ""Weekend"" and the surprisingly powerful rhythmic switch at the end of ""Ain't It Strange"".

In the past, Buffalo Daughter have often found themselves in the unfortunate position of being ""one of the other Japanese bands."" Though they share a sound with some of the other Japanese artists to penetrate the U.S. indie rock scene, they lacked Cornelius' vision, never came close to the touch and refinement of Takako Minekawa, and as for Shonen Knife, well... okay, they do just about everything better than Shonen Knife. But still, though they've consistently come up with a great track or two per release, Buffalo Daughter has never distinguished themselves in any way. They're as eclectic as their peers, but something has been missing on previous releases for Grand Royal. After hearing this, their first record for Emperor Norton, I've finally figured out what it is: the songs. Buffalo Daughter produce exceptional-sounding tracks that cover a wide spectrum of genres, texture and mood; they perform well on a variety of instruments, and their voices blend nicely most of the time. But they don't write great songs-- too often, they don't even write good ones. Though they're genre-hopping like mad, and making all the sounds pretty, if you have people singing and you're adhering to pop structure, you best be writing some songs. So as usual, I has few standouts. The first of these is the fantastically catchy riff-rocker ""28 Nuts."" After an extended intro that sounds like the band tuning up in front of an orchestra, the crunch takes over, and Buffalo Daughter sound like the Primitives with the vocals pitched down an octave. Forget that the crude two-chord riff is the mirror image of the hook that drove ""Great Five Lakes""-- this is still a great track. Also fine is the title track, which does away with the electricity and opts for dreamy Brazilian pop, complete with some heartwarming flute. A half-notch below these is the midtempo, harmony-laden ""Mirror Ball,"" which has the prettiest melody on the album but eventually wears out its welcome as it passes the seven-minute mark. ""Discotheque du Paradis"" is an engaging slice of roller-rink pop with an unexpected Kraftwerk sample. The rest of I displays admirable diversity, but no great songs. The lumbering ""Earth Punk Rockers"" has a proggy cast to it and wants to sound like the Flaming Lips' ""The Gash,"" but ultimately the poor singing and non-existent melody sink it. ""Robot Sings (As If He Were Frank Sinatra with a Half-Boiled Egg and the Salt Shaker on a Breakfast Table)"" has a nice-enough title and, yes, vocodered vocals, but the limp structure just kind of lays there.

87,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10070-sparrow-trout-heart-sprout/,2007-04-09T06:00:03,['Best of Seth'],Sparrow Trout Heart Sprout,"Prolific Akron Familyman Seth Olinsky recorded this 3xCD set in late 2004 and early 2005 as a limited CD-R, eventually consenting to have it remixed and given a proper release. Akron/Family make a lot of music. Since recording their self-titled debut for Young God Records in late 2004, the quasi-Brooklyn group has released a split with the Angels of Light and a 35-minute EP. Their second LP is due in September. Before acting as Michael Gira's band for the second side of the split, they backed him on Angels of Light's Sings Other People and the forthcoming We Are Him. What's more, this is a band that works best (and mostly) on the stage: Last year alone, they played more than 200 shows, most of those happily barreling past the two-hour mark. They've released a half-dozen handmade EPs, too. Maddeningly creative and enthusiastically prolific, Akron/Family loves being a band. Familyman Seth Olinsky made Sparrow Trout Heart Sprout-- a 3xCD set recorded between fall 2004 and winter 2005-- with his first M-Box, a personal copy of ProTools, and a relaxed job at a new Brooklyn coffee shop. A/F was waiting for their first record to be released and for their first national tour. Almost three years ago, these 42 songs let Olinsky occupy the interim. Then, on the eve of tour, he hurriedly pressed 25 CD-R copies. Two years later, two friends convinced him to let them remix the tapes-- 163 minutes of music, or a drop in the Akron bucket-- and package them as Sparrow Trout Heart Sprout. Indeed, it's important to remember that Sparrow was never intended for release, let alone to serve as a solo statement from one of the brightest lights in American music. Instead, it's a humble set of songs, a very intimate collection from a Penn's Woods boy living life and making music in the big city, dealing with his relationship troubles and his acceptance of a finite role in an infinite cosmos through song. Olinsky builds a universe of ideas, undeveloped though they may be, and ensconces himself in the middle. Some of the guitar solos are misses, some of the lyrics are cutely obtuse, and some of the lo-fi production demands a second opinion. But, here, Olinsky is not worried with landing a single hook as much as he is experimenting with influences and inspirations: Elementary anecdotes and declarations (""You are the saddest turtle in the world,"" goes one gem) become Zen-shaped reflections on existence. Simple folk songs for acoustic guitar reach for the atmosphere, colored by the long-tone kaleidoscopic ideas of Terry Riley and the free improvisation influences of Derek Bailey and William Parker. Plaintive, image-rich confessionals come peppered with sketches (an early version of Akron anthem ""Blessing Force"" shows promise, if not development) for the harmonies that have become a Familial definition. In its way, Sparrow Trout Heart Sprout mirrors Panda Bear's solo debut, Young Prayer, as both a wide-open musical experiment and a pragmatic coping mechanism. Love songs are met by damaged break-up blues, and those are surrounded by a Zen-like acquiescence to a broader reality. A five-track stretch on Sparrow, the third disc, encompasses all three modes: There's a song of despair, one of adoration and three of ecumenical considerations, including a reference to Shambala founder Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and the naturally damaging effects of a crowded world. On one track, Olinsky leads with three minutes of unresolved improvisation for guitar, percussion, organ and flute. They fade as he sings, ""I'm going to come to terms with what's going on"" 10 times. As if to himself in a waking moment, he finally sings, ""And enjoy it.""  Life isn't perfect, and-- as if by allegory-- neither are these tracks. Of course, this isn't for everyone: Some of the ideas here are errant and could benefit from a proper studio, collaboration or deletion altogether. If you love Akron/Family's occasional sense of bombast and dynamic juxtaposition, you may not find much value in 42 tracks of quiet home recordings, especially since it still feels like Olinsky's trying to convince himself to sing out here. And if you've ever written either Akron/Family's nebulously spiritual lyrics or sonic enthusiasm (read: jamming) off as puerile, Sparrow Trout Heart Sprout won't change your mind. But that's not the point. ""With the crowds, with the birds/ I am less the reminder of propriety or qualities/ And more the reminder of life!/ And go on the square for my own sake,"" says Olinsky on ""Where the Grass Tales Me"", an extended riff on Whitman's ""Song of Myself."" On Sparrow Trout Heart Sprout, he's riding instinct and trying to feel good about himself and his ideas. In a universe so big, buying in is always completely optional.",Best of Seth: Sparrow Trout Heart Sprout Album Review | Pitchfork,6.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
88,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10071-score/,2007-04-04T06:00:00,['Matthew Herbert'],Score,"A collection of music penned for a series of independent films from 1997 to 2007, this is more in line with 2003's big band-inspired Goodbye Swingtime than the producer's better-known works. Though he first earned a rep as a proto-microhouse producer possessed of an uncommonly witty sampler, Matthew Herbert has become best known for records that sample a hundred people eating apples and then turns the crunches and slurps into a techno track with lyrics by John Pilger. So you may be surprised to learn that Score is just that, a collection of music Herbert penned for a series of independent films from 1997 to 2007. Come to it expecting the man's usual mix of musique concrète-style sampling, torch songs, and leftist politicking, and you might walk away disappointed. On the other hand, I thought the photo of a collapsed house on the back cover was just Herbert punning on this album's lack of beats, until I noticed in the credits that it's taken from post-July War Lebanon in 2006. No matter the venue, Herbert can't resist a little social commentary, even subtly. Score is more in line with Goodbye Swingtime, Herbert's somewhat unfairly maligned big band jazz album from 2003, albeit minus the guest singers that were there to liven up what was otherwise a very faithful, if somewhat arch, homage to the swing era. Since the music on Score both pre- and post-dates Goodbye Swingtime, it's clear that jazz has long been an abiding interest for Herbert. (Of course, that was also more than evident from his house singles.) His métier here is post-war Rat Pack vehicles and Cold War thrillers, their scores a mix of then-current cocky American jazz cool and a continental European black market intrigue and lovelorn post-Luftwaffe ennui. ""Café de Flore (Trio Reprise)"" is an accordion-led sketch of a Parisian cobblestone square, and ""Rivoli Shuffle"", a nimble dance for piano and brass, is the spitting musical image of a two-bit, card-shuffling hustler in a cheap sharkskin suit. Herbert's musical research into the era means his orchestral jazz is certainly competent, but often the album is at its best on tracks like the analogue Aphex Twin wistfulness of ""End"" and album opener ""Funereal,"" a mournful miniature for strings that does a fine job of evoking a rain soaked graveyard--just right for opening or ending your film noir. At 10:29, ""Rendezvous"" is both the album's most ambitious and most idiosyncratic piece of music. A barely audible ambient burbling of a beat lurks in the background throughout, topped with full-on choral writing for a male and female ensemble that shifts unexpectedly into tense moments of constricted techno, like a high Catholic mass suddenly breaking into a Clear Records 12-inch. The album's low point is a 2001 take on ""Singin' in the Rain"", fine as a muted instrumental jazz reading of the cinematic chestnut but made silly by the buzzes, hums, and glitch-y CD skips and stutters that Herbert adds as window-dressing. It's like a Hollywood agent's idea of ""futuristic jazz."" On the other hand, the guitar of ""Blood and Hair"", likewise poked and prodded with his computer, is flush with enough Galouises smoke and digital unease to suggest it might be a good choice for a modern remake of The Third Man. (Note to Hollywood: Please don't remake The Third Man. You'd probably cast Vince Vaughn as Harry Lime or something.) Like 1996's 100 Lbs., reissued last year, Score will be something of a curio to anyone who hasn't already swallowed the Herbert kool-aid or who isn't a already a ravenous consumer of soundtracks and scores. Unlike the bump-and-flicker of Herbert's earliest deep house singles collected on 100 Lbs., however, Score won't even satisfy the beat heads, though if you were an enterprising, Ableton-owning mp3jay, you could edit the two together and probably get something close to the man's more recent albums, where the slickly realized jazz pastiches and Nelson Riddle-on-a-Tescos-budget strings are deployed as part of Herbert's lush dance grooves. But though we may yet learn that these seemingly straightforward set-pieces and pretty musical backdrops are actually made not from actual strings but from Herbert sampling a duck's quacks or the shouts of an anti-war demonstration, Score is perhaps the least conceptual, most functional thing the man has ever put his name to.

The shaggy twentysomethings once heralded as the Southern Strokes have turned a corner. Long story short, the family act known for whipping up ""The O.C.""-friendly stews of Dixie rock and Detroit garage bravado has hopped on Bono's wagon. Maybe they dream of colonizing grander spaces by sanding their edges to capture a spacious, safe brand of rock'n'roll. Could arena rock be their ticket out of the 1970's? Will the matching body hair shtick follow? Six minutes into the swampland soap opera of ""Knocked Up"" you begin to doubt, haircuts aside, whether they truly have morphed into the Southern U2, and whether the universe would permit that. After a long rattling by Nathan Followill's crisp percussion, broken by passages of wall-like fuzz, you still have a minute left, and your doubts remain. The song's bare rhythms distract you from the movie-of-the-week yarn tangled above the simple sounds. This week: A couple who, parents be damned, are gonna have that baby. As a deathless testament to the father-to-be's devotion, or as a classic gesture of rebellion, the story just doesn't wash. It sounds a little stagey. Forays into romance like ""True Love Way"" and ""Arizona"" also tailspin into the ground. After all, despite their studio ambitions, the Kings still only have two subjects: Dangerous women and themselves. All their blurry visions of sin seem to zero in on girls who amused or wronged them, a train of femme fatales out of some sweaty bayou noir, forever pulling them off the straight and narrow. Poor country boys just can't catch a break, it seems. Seeking stability amid the rough-and-tumble, Kings of Leon still lean on regressive sonics. After beginning with a ghostly prelude straight off a Popol Vuh record, lead single ""On Call"" congeals into a straight-ahead rock song, complete with an agreeably noodly bridge and echoing hooks. On ""Black Thumbnail"", the Followills warp us back to the era of hair-metal bombast, too caught up with itself to build on the template. Unlike these one-dimensional time capsules, ""Charmer"" remains open to interpretation. First, as a sinister post-punk specimen, the bloody-murder shrieks of Black Francis slicing high above a subterranean Wire riff. Or second, as a recording of David Lee Roth being electrocuted à la the first Ghostbusters. Given the song's villain is another cardboard maneater stereotype (""She stole my karma, oh no/ Sold it to the farmer, oh no""), the latter reading seems a safer bet. A cynical, acoustic sing-along, ""Fans"" slyly presents narcissism as gratitude. (Remember the two themes.) You know the routine: the band tours, generously measures its own importance, then transcribes journal entries about the cosmic emptiness of fame. With two stanzas ending with ""Make a sound for me"" and ""The king they want to see,"" the song forms a heartfelt tribute to their real No. 1 fans: Kings of Leon. Flirtations with big-sky atmospherics can hardly hold these songs together. What sounds like a hodgepodge of Edgy experiments and raised-Zippo nostalgia is just that: a hodgepodge. If there is a common strand, it is the ugly, faux-blues notion that women are the fount of pain and suffering, the cause of the Followills' ""black as coal"" hearts. It makes Because of the Times sound suspiciously like a counterattack on womankind, launched from somewhere in the mid-1990s, deep inside a bruised, stadium-sized ego.",Kings of Leon: Because of the Times Album Review | Pitchfork,5.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

When Shearwater released Palo Santo in 2006, it wasn't simply a strong collection of moody folk songs. It was a stark, seductive, and mysterious crooked path through genres already tapped and exhausted in recent years, played as precious but still malleable in the hands of Okkervil River sideman Jonathan Meiburg and his band. It was a big leap for Shearwater, but more than that, it was a record that tapped into something intangible-- in this case a kind of backwoods atmosphere that's subtly creepy without any strain for authenticity. With the hiss of radio static, instruments whispering from deep within the mix, Meiburg's falsetto so gentle and lilting it was nearly inaudible at times, it felt more like a fog than an album in its gentler moments, yet had melodies so resilient they were startling in toothier tracks like ""White Waves"" or ""Red Sea, Black Sea"". So they decided to fuck with it. Leaving the nest of Misra for the wide open skies made available by Matador, Palo Santo is re-released this year not only with bonus material, but fully re-recorded versions of five songs and a brand-new cover that's like a Maurice Sendak drawing of a vampire marshmallow Peep. From the beginning of this expanded edition, things have changed: Meiburg's falsetto is clear as a bell on opener ""La Dame et la Licorne"", intermittent chords on piano suddenly sparkle, and his wail of ""Bring back my boy!"" is a sudden, stunning eyebrow-raiser rather than a strain to be heard. For better or for worse-- mostly better-- Palo Santo mk 2 is what these songs would sound like in a live setting: clearer compositions with sometimes subtle, occasionally suffocating arrangements. And while it's got a little less of that lo-fi romance, it's hardly compromising Meiburg's vision. For all its quiet mystery, I no longer have to put my head next to the speaker to hear all of ""La Dame et la Licorne"", mixed far too quietly before. There are moments one might miss from the original, notably the ominous throb of keyboard under the banjo pluck of ""Red Sea, Black Sea"" now erased, which previously made the song for me. It now moves from calm to cacophonous in its final moments, rather than a sustaining tension throughout. ""Red Sea"" is probably the most glaring change, whereas in the recut piano-driven tracks ""Seventy-Four, Seventy-Five"" and ""Johnny Viola"", they're simply clearer and crisper, have more audible bass and trumpet, a little more crunch from the guitars, or-- in the case of ""Seventy""-- more discernible dynamics during its Talk Talk-esque spells. What we're left with is being face-to-face with the song itself, not its atmosphere. ""Hail, Mary"" alone maybe tips its hand too much, with a new full-band heave that doesn't need the full stops to underline its slippery pre-chorus, though the following crescendo is a little more cathartic now without the Casio blurts from the original. The appendix EP offers a tantalizing look at what's to come in the cool, airy pluck of ""My Only Boy"", but barring a few ambient diversions, it's mostly what you'd expect-- folkier, mustier demos of the quieter moments of Palo Santo, songs that offer little revelation aside from the fact that a strong song sounds just as good when unplugged (or further unplugged). As a standalone EP it wouldn't work, but it's a thoughtful addendum, even if this new edition would be worth picking up even without it. The original Misra version remains worth seeking out if you haven't, but what made the record a huge step forward, changing Shearwater from side project to a ""real band,"" remains intact: an effortless plurality of mood that stands in stark contrast with their earlier records, less predictable instrumentation in songs like ""Red Sea, Black Sea"" or ""Failed Queen"", and the strength of Meiburg's voice. Most bands don't have this sort of chance, nor take it-- I imagine many would be afraid of jinxing what's an already successful record. But there's only so much you can do to foul up a song that works, and fixing what may or may not have been broken doesn't hurt Palo Santo.

There's a surprise at the start of XBXRX's third album: a four-minute song. The Oakland band's tunes rarely last longer than two minutes, so opening with the relatively epic ""Center Where Sight"" could be seen as a kind of ""we're serious now"" statement. And Wars does turn out to be the most serious XBXRX record so far. Intricate structures, jazzy stop-starts, and dramatic crescendos all suggest a new level of craft from this caffeinated post-hardcore outfit. This is still XBXRX though-- Wars is, after all, only 27 minutes long-- and the band's raging momentum and endless energy persist. No extended solos or instrumental wankoffs here; this is resolutely a slamming punk record, just a little less Black Flag and a little more Minutemen than before. Hurtling forward with no interest in subtlety or restraint, XBXRX's music is as exhausting to listen to as it must be to play. But Wars is a step forward for a band who crashed out of the gate as teenagers and shows no signs of burnout a decade later. The best songs here push the group's frantic chops ahead without losing the essential noise-wall. The crushing pound of ""Freezing Water"" finds a mid-point between Lightning Bolt's robotic fury and the Jesus Lizard's dark drool. ""Here to Ruin the Party"" sounds like an outtake from the Minutemen's What Makes a Man Start Fires?, as rubbery bass, slashing guitar, and cryptic slogans fly by at hardcore speed. The album's peak comes on ""Minds"", a proggy sprint filled with knife-sharp rhythms. Despite the new twists and turns, XBXRX still have just a single gear, and the band's permanent fast-forward mode sometimes flattens what could be distinct peaks and valleys into a one-dimensional wash. Sonically, XBXRX's palette is similarly limited. The fiery vocals and jolting guitar rarely vary in tone, even when the songs seem to blatantly beg for it. The result is an album that, at under a half-hour, still feels too long. One exception to the band's loud-fast rules is closer ""Ear Ever Hear"", a more spacious piece whose disconnected riffs and sliced rhythms make the group sound like a baby Deerhoof. That intriguing move bodes well for XBXRX's next step-- a purported ""experimental improvisation-based album""-- but there are enough new ideas throughout Wars to make the band worth watching, regardless of future plans.",XBXRX: Wars Album Review | Pitchfork,6.8,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
92,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10075-most-wanted/,2007-04-11T06:00:04,['Yellowman'],Most Wanted,"Greensleeves offers an excellent point of entry to this legendary-- and unlikely-- 1980s dancehall star. When Biggie once declared himself ""heartthrob never, black and ugly as ever,"" I thought for years he was saying ""fat"" instead of ""black."" The actual lyric is more pointed, bringing race and class into the mix of Big's offhand interrogation of the American ideal of ""sexy,"" but my mishearing makes the same basic point: This mountainous figure with a lazy eye and a bulldog's grimace was one of the most unlikely sex symbols of the 1990s, a ""fat motherfucker"" who could step to a chiseled god like Tupac Shakur. As anyone with crooked teeth or a paunch knows, self-possession, wit, and swagger count for a lot when you're looking for love. And in the history of unlikely rapping sex symbols-- a few internet maniacs like John Darnielle aside-- Biggie is perhaps only rivaled by Winston Foster, a Jamaican dancehall deejay cursed with a name he flipped into a money-minting blessing. For Foster, born an albino in a country where that particular biological quirk drops you to the bottom of the social rung, any sort of stardom as a professional musician was going to come from a knowing novelty appeal and a dogged, talented persistence. Recording a string of early, pre-digital dancehall hits with a producer named Henry ""Junjo"" Lawes and his house band, the Roots Radics, Yellowman was the Biggie of his era: a gun-toting cocksman in a wide-brimmed hat who fit none of the usual images of a swaggering pop phenomenon. This gave him instant novelty appeal, but it was his immense natural skill that actually put him over the top. Being a fat dude in a body conscious society is one thing; Foster's audiences were first downright shocked and outraged-- and then delighted-- to hear a supposedly sexually-undesirable ""outcast"" rapping about wrecking pum pums and toting heat, leaning through Kingston in a big ol' Caddie. Most Wanted is a new Yellowman greatest hits collection from Greensleeves, and since the man never made a Ready to Die, it's an excellent point of entry to his mackadocious island aesthetic. But go in expecting Biggie's jump-up machine gun funk and you'll be surprised; these wobbly tracks-- 16 variations of drum, bass, and Yellowman's brags and boasts repeated with the metronomic surety of ""This Is Why I'm Hot""-- have the waist-winding sway of the best old school reggae. For dance tunes, Yellowman records sure are slow. Modern dancehall and soca bounces off the walls to a diet of, as one recent riddim put it, ""Red Bull and Guinness"". These are spliff-calmed, afternoon-nap-in-the-hammock grooves. (The inclusion of several six- or seven-minute 12"" mixes only accentuates the repetition, complete with occasionally patience-testing head-nodder instrumental outros.) And the Roots Radics craft rhythms like they're expert set designers commissioned by a theater company with enough money for two props and one spotlight. Yellowman's the star, and the music mostly stays out of his way on stage, save for some dub special effects or keyboard lighting tricks. What made Yellowman that kind of star is his larger-than-life, chest-puffing, can-you-top-this, I-will-steal-your-woman-and-she'll-love-it shit-talking, ever more outlandish because he knew no one took him seriously to begin with. And so this is exceptionally dirty music sometimes. When he sings ""gimme the morning ride"" that ""slips and slides,"" he's not singing about a lazy country drive or a horseback ride across the beach. Not an enlightened or even classy dude-- but like Biggie's gangsta moll fidelity fantasies on ""Me and My Bitch"", though thankfully without the offer of paternal fellatio-- Yellow does dream about a ghetto domestic partnership where ""me cook the chicken and you cook the rice"" on ""Yellowman Getting Married"", even if his vision of martial bliss is less about hiding his guns from the cops and closer to that of his sly sex chat descendent Vybz Kartel. You know, picturing him and his lady in a tree, f-u-c-k-i-n-g. But of all the words you could use to describe Yellowman's flow, ""nimble"" and ""inventive"" would be among the last; like most deejays of his early-80s era, he chats almost exclusively in a flat, mid-tempo monotone, heavy on the catch phrase, which stylistically makes him less like Biggie and more like the dapper snapper rappers of the dirty south. Like a Dem Franchize or D4L album, if exponentially wittier, Most Wanted's minimalism gets a little exhausting by the end. And also like snap music, Yellowman's best tune is also his biggest hit, ""Zungguzungguzungguzeng"", and if you want to know if Most Wanted is for you, try chanting that alliterative run-on in your own best monotone for as long as you can stand it. It's the best because that hypnotic hook is the most hypnotic, and the beat is the deadliest, adding some fierce flashes of phased guitar without compromising the basic groove established at the record's opening. Everyone could use some of Yellow's rub-a-dub style in their life, but an hour or more might have you zungguzenging all the way to the loony bin.

Poor old UK hip-hop. Either mired in the true-school aesthetic of its Stateside progenitor or cowed into submission by the delinquent grit of grime, it's just never been a particularly interesting proposition. Fortunately, though, a few notable exceptions disprove the rule-- chief among them Infinite Livez. Where Britrap's stuffiest practitioners concern themselves with following a tradition of mildewed Transatlantic authenticity and the sound of London pirate radio reflects home-grown street life with rough-hewn aplomb but rarely looks any further than its own ends, this one-man lyrical sideshow has found a unique niche by keeping it surreal. Trained at Chelsea College of Art & Design and frequently appearing on stage with a glove-puppet alter ego named Barry Convex, Vinnie Tiefilz (as he likes to call himself in person) whiles away his time making improvised noise CDs, drawing, and sewing. Pretty obvious that he's not your average rapper-- and that's before even thinking about the bizarre imaginary worlds weaved in his choppy Cockney rhymes. Take, for instance, the stand-out moments from Bush Meat, his 2004 debut album. ""The Adventures of the Lactating Man"" tells the tale of an everyday Joe who suddenly finds himself the proud owner of a fully functioning set of breasts, while ""Pononee Girl"" offers a first-person account of a one-night stand with a My Little Pony toy. All told, it was quite the calling card-- a brilliantly realized, yet utterly demented collage of scatological wit and perverse fantasy. Now Livez has found rhythms strange enough to match his rhymes, joining Swiss electronic improv duo Stade on Art Brut Fe De Yoot. Recorded on the fly, then subjected to as little subsequent editing as possible, it's an album as immediate as it is confounding. Mixing occasionally soul crooning-- some great, some wildly and deliberately out-of-tune-- with abstract, spoken word raps, the vocals are run through sequences of effects or simply left to sprawl over Pierre Audétat and Christophe Calpini's dissonant, de-funked instrumentals. For the most part, it's a perfect fit, especially the scattershot, disjointed ""Unbiased Reductionism in 21st Century Music Practices"" and the beautifully titled ""Artyfartypartynazi"". However, the marriage is occasionally uneasy and directionless, as if the words need some semblance of normality to keep at least a toehold on the real world. Still, the points where it does fall apart (""The Taste of Jazz to Cum"") remain a small price to pay for a record as deliriously daft and unashamedly experimental as this. That's what it's all about-- balance. As difficult and twisted as it may get, there's always a laugh to pull Art Brut back together. Packed with references to man-eating monsters, evil geniuses ""stroking pussies,"" talking kitchen appliances, and-- most gloriously-- the impact of diaper fetishism on a devotee's wife and family, it may be weird and crass, but there's a wry, streetwise quality to all the deviance, a mischievous joy in storytelling and a keen appreciation of the absurd. It's this that makes Livez so obviously English, many of his songs like sounding like overheard pub conversations from some parallel, Pythonesque universe. Endearingly eccentric, he's enough to make you think that all UK hip-hop should be made up of equal parts Kool Keith and Benny Hill.",Infinite Livez: Art Brut Fe De Yoot Album Review | Pitchfork,6.8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It shouldn't be too controversial for me to say that most bands get more normal as they go along-- they refine themselves, expand their audiences, raise their production values, and clean up all those leftover quirks from back when they didn't think too many people were paying attention anyway. ADULT., being giant weirdos, are one of those bands who've done the opposite, getting progressively more strange and insular. The music on Why Bother? may not be leagues away from the shrieky, gothic electro-punk that's become their signature, but it is different, and it's definitely stranger: Suddenly ADULT. are coming to you from somewhere inside what would seem to be a giant tank of very cold water. These are the same blurting drum machines and scratchy bass lines, but they've gone a bit distant and woozy, with hazy reverb and detuned synths wobbling all around. Well: Getting more accessible was always a long shot for an act this single-mindedly concerned with themes of discomfort, anxiety, and annoyance. That stuff isn't going anywhere, as a glance at the tracklist will confirm. The lead single is ""I Feel Worse When I'm with You"", a classically ADULT. barnstormer whose video depicts a day in the Adam Lee Miller/Nicola Kuperus household as a string of attempts to kill either themselves or one another; it's surrounded by tracks like ""You Don't Worry Enough"", ""Inclined to Vomit"", and ""Plagued by Fear."" Kuperus's imagination still focuses on nausea, weapons, panic attacks, poison, CPR, taxidermy, and those murder-mystery photographs of people who may be unconscious but are probably dead-- you know, typical Michigan stuff. Rest assured that they have some sense of humor/irony about these things, if not always as much as you'd like. And this record backs off on the punk charge (and the goth affectations) to let that good-times creepshow just sit and simmer. ""Red Herring"" has Kuperus actually singing, melodically-- for the first time in a while-- as an eerie, clanging synth backing runs in place like a giant machine; same goes for the terrific ""Good Deeds"", whose tempo is actually so high that the whole thing winds up feeling ominously static. Elsewhere, ""Harvest"" is all industrial ambience, while two parts of something called ""The Importance of Being Folk"" serve as soundtrack music to a short film involving needlepoint, a rusty axe, and a hexagram. None of this, however, stops the band from delivering some of the deliciously grating, high-energy stuff fans expect: ""Inclined to Vomit"" is pure pound and screech, and ""You Don't Worry Enough"" unleashes some hesher-friendly fuzz bass for what feels like the closest ADULT. will ever get to cock rock. Stranger and stranger, then, and yet we all still know what kind of world we're being invited into with each new ADULT. release: Slow or fast, clean or dirty, underwater or above ground, fans of nerves, paranoia, and the inability to speak will always get what's coming to them. It's a little disappointing that none of the band's stylistic shifts have let them bloom into much more, but as furrows for ploughing go, this one's still pretty fascinating, and still all theirs.",ADULT.: Why Bother?

It's only natural to want to translate the Germanic song titles of Dominik Eulberg, in part because they're said to derive from nature. No reference to Eulberg as a DJ/producer goes without mention of his also having worked as a park ranger, and what could be more novel than a German techno artist who talks about birds and trees when he's not busy being post-human? It turns out that Eulberg's organic fancies are something of a vorläufige Emissionsprospekte (read: a ""red herring,"" at least as per Babel Fish). Those fancies have proven significant in the past, most notably on his fabled DJ mix Kreucht & Fleucht, which evoked a sense of growing, evolving, photosynthesizing, and so on. But nature's calls rarely figure into what Eulberg's own work actually communicates, even when they're supposed to. It's not for lack of trying. Heimische Gefilde, a collection of 12-inches strung together as Eulberg's second artist album, features a host of spoken-word passages in which the producer meditates on nature like a figure from a scholastic filmstrip. (The album title translates as ""native habitat."") In one such passage, he talks about the uhu and mouths owl sounds to serve his subject. The owls are not what they seem, though, as per timeless wisdom gleaned from Twin Peaks. Even when his muse is ostensibly a bird, Eulberg's method draws on a decidedly mechanical mix of clattering noises and whooshing trance effects writ large and small. It's what makes him simultaneously minimal and maximal-- and not the least bit natural in terms of style or sound. The spoken-word bits prove nagging to an ear unschooled in German, but the music that separates them rubs a lot of different receptors elsewhere in the head. Indeed, Eulberg's is a uniquely heady kind of trance, in which stirring drama arises out of details made hectic down below. Tracks like ""Adler"" and ""Rote Waldameise"" run the kind of atmospheric smears and sirens you might hear in a super-club over rustling, fidgety rhythms mindful of a basement techno dive. In ""Die Alpenstrandläufer von Spiekeroog"" (that's ""the Alpine sandpipers of Spiekeroog""), Eulberg crafts a taut beat out of the wheezing sounds of industry more than anything winged. Eulberg is at his best when he's at his busiest-- as in ""Björn Borkenkäfer"" and ""Die Rotbauchunken vom Tegernsee"", tracks that cycle through a musique concrète composer's bank of sounds in a manic rush. The beats shift to take in flurries of new percussive timbres, and Eulberg's trancey hand proves most deft when laying on swirling synths after the bulk of his work is already done. It's a technique that plays out in ""Harzer Roller"", a mesmerizing track that evokes the momentous glide of an airplane more than the flitting canary in its title.",Dominik Eulberg: Heimische Gefilde Album Review | Pitchfork,7.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The songs on 31Knots' fifth full-length are superficially interesting because of their instrumental or lyrical barrages and clever production; frontman Joe Haege writes about the daily rat race or dogmatic defeat and sounds like Zach de la Rocha rooming with Cedric Bixler in college. But it gets boring fast: The 11 songs on The Days and Nights come in different outfits, all covering the same thin, half-baked, post-grad body concerned with how done society is or how over people Haege is. The musical inspiration is clear. Note the Shipping News hyper-rhythm of ""The Salted Tongue"" and the cabaret punk of ""Savage Boutique"", or the June of 44 vibraphones of ""Everything in Letters"" and the piano pleading of ""Pulse of a Decimal"". Still, hear 'em all several times and all that sticks are meaningless twists of phrase, vocal over-exacerbation, and instrumental dexterity that doesn't know tantalization from taste. If The Days and Nights has one underlying fault, it's that nothing about it feels personal or developed enough. Haege and his trio understand song structure and movement, but everything about the 11 tracks here feels either clever or finished by half. Lyrically, Haege trades the specificities of his experiences for the vagaries of his condescending commentary, telling us what he thinks about everything instead of showing us he has a reason to know anything. He writes songs without handlebars. He frames those laments in first person, but it sounds more like he's preaching than pleading. Haege's voice is always at a full melodramatic tilt, too, the sound of a man safe in a studio as he tells us how we should be. Do lines like ""Walk between the raindrops for a dollar a day/ It's tragic you're so tardy or just fashionably late/ A savage in surrender with vicious intent"" actually compel anyone, even when shouted? Still, even for a band that's chomping at the social bit, they've made a record that's remarkably normal. Though they sample Archie Shepp and Beethoven on one track (without much purpose), they also hack standard scales for long-winded instrumental excursions (see ""The Salted Tongue"", which also includes a drum solo) and conclude the record with an ""epic"" track that's subdivided between equal noise and big, distended harmonies ready-made for an outro. The Days and Nights is a least-common denominator indie rock album, borrowing cues from the last two decades of things you've probably loved. If Haege would just fess up and stop telling us he's ""assassin of the reason you want to exist,"" it would be a bit more bearable. It would also help if the band would stop depending on production for making songs sound different.",31Knots: The Days and Nights of Everything Anywhere Album Review | Pitchfork,4.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
97,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10080-tower-featuring-verde/,2007-04-11T06:00:05,['Circle'],Tower [ft. Verde],"The tireless Circle have released more than 30 records during a 16-year career, so it's no shock that the band has managed to change and evolve. Despite a self-appointed induction into ""The New Wave of Finnish Heavy Metal,"" Circle have actually dabbled in a wide range of sounds, including post-rock, prog, jazz, dub, and more. So holding the Finnish group to a single stylistic standard would be both unfair and pointless. Still, it's hard not to be perplexed by the band's recent direction. They seem to have plucked out the sparser, mellower, and cheesier moments in their repertoire and strung them together, discarding the intriguing time-changes, rock-riff twists, and inverted metal clichés of previous efforts. On last year's double CD Miljard this skyward drift worked pretty well, since the group's dreamy ambience was grounded by a strong dose of open-ended improvisation. Not so with Tower, a six-song instrumental album made in collaboration with Finnish electronic musician Mika Rintala, aka Verde. Here Circle takes their New Age tendencies to an extreme, and the results are uneventful and sometimes just boring. Sounding like too-stoned-to-stand 60s jammers, the band doles out repetitive, twinkling cycles of Fusion-ish jazz-rock. Each track starts with a lax loop and rarely budges or builds, resulting in predictable tunes that end where they started. At best, some moments evoke the Kraut hypnosis of Can or Amon Duul. But more often Circle come off as a weak approximation of the Doors playing Fusion. The album's highlights occur on its first two tracks, ""Gerde"" and ""Gåttø"". Both are more active than the rest; the latter particularly nudges forward due to rattling, propulsive percussion reminiscent of the No-Neck Blues Band's tribal explorations. Notice, though, how both titles start with ""G""-- so does every other track on Tower. That may be meant as a clever trope, but it's also an indicator of how little variety the album holds. Each tune uses the same narrow sonic palette (most noticeably an overly cool Manzarek-style organ tone), making it exceedingly hard to remember which track is which. Maybe Tower works as background music, if such a thing can be said to ""work."" At least the album's mediocrity isn't particularly offensive or annoying. But when you're talking about a band with such a varied and stellar track record, that's depressingly faint praise.",Circle: Tower [ft. Verde] Album Review | Pitchfork,4.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
98,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10081-king-for-a-day/,2007-04-12T06:00:03,['Bobby Conn'],King for a Day,"Thrill Jockey showman continues to display both an impressive wit and a ceaseless dedication to his musical craft. Around the time of his 1998 album Rise Up! Bobby Conn discussed his musical goals with the print zine Puncture. Paul McCartney's ""Live and Let Die"" inspired him, especially how each section was it's own thing-- first it's a piano ballad, then there's a little reggae section in the bridge. He hoped that one day his own catalog might serve as a complete history of Western pop in miniature, with every possible subgenre covered in at least part of one track. You have to take everything a trickster like Conn says to an interviewer with a grain of salt, of course, but three full-lengths, a live album, and some EPs later, he's certainly covered a tremendous amount of ground. Conn's albums tend to orbit around a single theme lyrically-- wealth and success on Golden Age, the politics of fear in The Homeland-- but musically they usually jump from glam rock sleaze to show music pomp to pseudo-confessional singer/songwriter tenderness to classic rock boogie to soulful r&b croon, often within a single song. If Conn's bombastic turns and stylistic ping-ponging sounded daring and unusual in the late 1990s, when prog was lying dormant and Jim Steinman's name was still spoken through clenched teeth, it now seems perfectly normal. In this post-Fiery Furnaces age we expect our quirky and ambitious indie pop artists to play around with genre. So Conn's newest, King for a Day, is as restless as you'd expect, which makes it easier to enjoy as an album. Setting aside the element of surprise, we're left with a dozen widely varying songs about celebrity, ego, and the distorting effects of show business. While he approaches his subject with a typically smug edge befitting his over-the-top ""showman"" persona, Conn also cuts that quality with impressive wit and a ceaseless dedication to musical craft. This is a very big sounding record, sharply arranged for Conn's band the Glass Gypsies and assorted guests. The eight-minute opener ""Vanitas"" begins with a clear acoustic guitar pattern and vaguely Middle Eastern violin from Monica Boubou, but after some chanting the electric guitars kick in and all of a sudden everything is all rock'n'roll animal. The crunch continues as a phalanx of layered voices conjure images of King Arthur on Ice-levels of excess-- did I mention that the lyrics are in Latin? The first English we hear form Conn is the words ""I feel old-fashioned when we fuck in the dark"" on ""When the Money's Gone"", which follows the glorious opener without a pause. So we know he's still got a dirty mind and, with the song's bouncy melody and bumping little guitar riff, that he's still writing some catchy songs. Having spent his entire career thinking in concept album terms, Conn is by now a master of structure and pacing, as he weaves conventional songs that run the gamut with instrumentals (the marching and proggy ""A Glimpse of Paradise"") and spoken-word goofs (""Punch the Sky"", which seems to riff on Scientology). The falsetto-voiced ""Twenty One"" alludes to Philly-soul's proto-disco, while ""Love Let Me Down"" is jaunty, swinging baroque pop-- my wife walked in on the chorus and thought it might be Belle & Sebastian. King for a Day ranks with Rise Up! as Conn's best. Still, as good as the record sounds and as capably as he immerses himself in assorted flavors pop, there remains an odd sense of distance to Conn on record. Between his persona, his themes, the piles of instruments, and the thick arrangements, Conn's music is deliberately structured without a discernible center. There's nothing easy to grab onto. Which, viewed another way, is a strength. There seems little chance that Conn's music will ossify; his perpetual reinvention and undeniable talent suggest that he'll continue to make compelling records as long as the format still interests him. But for all their charms, his records are made for either quick infatuation or distant admiration; King for a Day is classic Conn, because it's hard to fall in love with.",Bobby Conn: King for a Day Album Review | Pitchfork,6.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
99,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10082-fluorescent-grey-ep/,2007-04-16T06:00:01,['Deerhunter'],Fluorescent Grey EP,"Best new music This stubbornly visionary band follows its stunning sophomore album Cryptograms with a set of four intensely focused songs recorded during their predecessor's mixing. Nearly three months have passed since Atlanta psych-rock quintet Deerhunter released their mammoth second full-length,  Cryptograms. Now, Kranky is putting out the Fluorescent Grey EP, a set of four intensely focused songs recorded while the album was being mixed. Though clearer and less abrasive than Cryptograms musically, the new EP foregrounds lead singer Bradford Cox's morbidly erotic lyrics about the body's inevitable decomposition-- to him, a psychosexual puzzle-- much as the full-length smothered its gorgeous melodies in effects-laden squall and instrumental ambience. Whether Fluorescent Grey is meant to serve as an epilogue (as its press release maintains) or prologue, the disc is a triumphant document of a stubbornly visionary young band with the world still spread out before them. ""I woke up,"" Fluorescent Grey begins, echoing the first words of Cryptograms' transformative ""Spring Hall Convert"". This time, though, the setting is the dark of night; the phrase ""fluorescent grey"" describes the color of a boy's dead flesh. Piano gets the EP's eponymous opening track off to a peaceful start, joined soon by crisply enunciated vocals and chiming guitar that patiently explodes into the band's familiar needle-burying territory. Once again Deerhunter's thematic interests align with those of author Dennis Cooper-- who named his most famous character after a dear ninth-grade friend (and later lover)-- as well as director Pedro Almodovar's Bad Education, which Cox cited as his favorite movie in a recent Pitchfork feature. ""Why do I dream so often of his body/ When his body will decay?"" Cox wonders in a wiry tenor, adding, ""You were my god in high school."" Just when Deerhunter seem most ready to take us into their confidence, otherworldly Sonic Youth whorls drown the singer's words, his trusty delay pedal lifting the song to an open-ended conclusion. Fluorescent Grey's taut compositions simmer with the doomed purity of Deerhunter's romantic vision. ""In the world there are so many useless bodies,"" Cox sings on midtempo ""Dr. Glass"", listing as examples ""all the couples kissing, the children missing, the corpses rotting."" His voice here is measured, accompanied by restrained organ-like loops, plus the usual guitar, bass, and drums. The closest thing on the EP to the chaos of Cryptograms' first third is high-school kiss reminiscence ""Wash Off"", which relies on droning motorik bass and treated vocal textures similar to those on the full-length's title track. ""I was 16,"" Cox repeats, his reserve finally shattering in an inspired racket. At the most basic level, what makes Deerhunter so profoundly affecting is the band's joy at rocking the fuck out-- free of both irony and any self-conscious lack thereof-- within their songs' impressive intellectual and emotional framework. ""Like New"" distills this energy into little more than two minutes, its dissolute guitars revolving around a deceptively soothing refrain. ""Back to the crypt again,"" Cox intones. The CD version of Fluorescent Grey (as opposed to the vinyl side included in the Cryptograms double-LP release) also includes the hypnotic video for ""Strange Lights"", bringing Deerhunter's current phase neatly full circle: Ashes to ashes, and then wake up all over again.",Deerhunter: Fluorescent Grey EP Album Review | Pitchfork,8.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
