# README

This site was branched from the [Indigo Jekyll theme](http://sergiokopplin.github.io/indigo) under the MIT License.

Now it hosts my personal website. Nothing too exciting, but a public face. 

todo:
- background color
- maybe a tiny little write up on some previous work
- a write up on the smart alarm
