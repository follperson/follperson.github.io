<p>
I'm a young professional interested in statistics applied to modern data, especially social networked data.

I am am currently a software developer / reporting data analyst at the Oakleaf Group, a small financial consulting firm based in DC-MD-VA area. I have a degree in Economics from Oberlin College. I wrote my Honors Thesis on the geographic distribution of urban public expenditure in New York City. I also studied psychology, which I found to be fascinating, if futile. My primary academic thread of interest has been human decision making, and have found both economic theory and pyschology lacking. I taught myself Python one January Winter-Term, home from college, and have been self-teaching through stack-overflow, tutorials, and some Coursera courses since.

I am a feminist and anti-racist, though I could be certainly be better. I recognize the USA's economic system to be unjust and inefficient. 

I am an everyday cyclist, as well as a long-term tourer when I find the time. I like to dance to music or as Contact Improvization, though I haven't been to a jam in about a year. I am constantly listening to all sorts of music. If you want to check out what I am listen to, see my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/mathtractor). or my [Spotify 2018 Year in Review](https://spotifywrapped.com/share/2c30f124d0).

I am currently applying to graduate school in statistics, or statistics focused data-science. 

I recognize the existential threat to humanity in the 21st century to be climate change, and the existential threat to humanity in the first quarter of the 21st century to be the transformation of social interaction through the internet.

I want to research social networks from a psycho-social perspective, examining and developing tools to remediate this problem.
