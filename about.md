## Bio

### Profesional

Hi, and welcome! My name is Andrew Follmann (He/him/his), and I am a data scientist! I like to work on diverse problems
with specific computational and statistically compelling components. I became a data scientist 
to learn about all sorts of problems from in different domains, and try to create solutions with
subject matter experts. Feel free to reach out at my [email](mailto:{{site.email}}). 

I am currently a Data Scientist at Thomson Reuters Special Services. Here I work on compelling problems
from government clients. Recently, I led a small team which competed and awarded in the [xView3 challenge](https://iuu.xview.us/),
which was a fun and rewarding deep dive into Synthetic Aperture Radar data and satellite imagery generally. 
I also am working on a mixture modeling python package, which is forthcoming.

I have a Masters from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon, 
with a curriculum oriented towards application and good software practice. Previously I worked at The Oakleaf Group, 
a small financial analysis firm primarily supporting litigation against the trustees (big banks) who did not, 
as fiduciaries, protect their investors in Residential Mortgage Backed Securities during the 2007-8 financial crisis. My 
role here was dual as a generalist programmer building reports, automating workflows, and moving data to support forensic underwriters, 
as well as data engineering in gathering, cleaning, loading and verifying bond waterfalls and payouts 
to support financial analysts. 

My undergraduate work was in mathematical economics at Oberlin College, with substantial coursework in psychology and politics. 
My undergraduate honors thesis explored the [geographic distribution of urban public services, specifically
sanitation and police expenditure in New York City]({{site.url}}/EconThesis.html)

### Personal


I am an everyday cyclist, as well as a cycle tourist when I find the time. I have three bikes at the moment, 
a [ruby red '81 Schwinn Traveler]({{site.url}}/assets/images/fixie-pgh.jpg) converted to a city fixie,
a ['94 forest green Shogun Alpine GT]({{site.url}}/assets/images/bike-selfie.jpg) for touring,
and a middling hard tail aluminum mountain bike I don't know enough about! 

I've cycled down the [West Coast]({{site.url}}/assets/images/ca-coast.jpg) from [Canada to Mexico]({{site.url}}/assets/images/ca-bike.jpg), 
around [Northern Italy and Tuscany]({{site.url}}/assets/images/tuscan-O.JPG), 
and the length of the [Blue Ridge Parkway]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blue-ridge-bike.jpg), from Maryland through North Carolina, 
as well as other shorter tours in between. 
I love the outdoors, and try to get out hiking, camping, mountain biking, and skiing as often as I can.

I do my best to bring nature indoors with me, with a sprawling houseplant collection - making due as best I can 
without a garden to tend.
