## Bio

### Profesional

Hi, and welcome! My name is Andrew Follmann Wyld (He/him/his), and I am a data scientist. I currently work for [CleanChoice Energy](https://cleanchoiceenergy.com/), 
where I build models and ML infrastructure to support customer acquisiton and solar array facility siting. 

I have a Masters Degree (2020) from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon. 
I previously held a position at Thomson Reuters, working on [anomaly detection using mixture models]({{site.url}}/Anomix),
[ship detection on SAR imagery]({{site.url}}/xView3), and [social network analysis]({{site.url}}/community-detection-social-media). Prior to that I spent some time
building experience with Residential Mortgage Backed Securities at [The Oakleaf Group](https://oakleaf.com/).

My undergraduate work was in mathematical economics at Oberlin College, with substantial coursework in psychology and politics. 
My undergraduate honors thesis explored the [geographic distribution of urban public services, specifically
sanitation and police expenditure in New York City]({{site.url}}/EconThesis/)

### Personal

I live in the Takoma/Manor Park, Washington D.C., with my wife Alex, our daughter Lassen and our two cats 
[Mingus]({{site.url}}/assets/images/mingus-shelf.jpg) 
and [Dizzie]({{site.url}}/assets/images/dizzy.jpg).

I am an everyday cyclist, as well as a cycle tourist when I find the time. I have three bikes at the moment, 
a [ruby red '81 Schwinn Traveler]({{site.url}}/assets/images/fixie-pgh.jpg) converted to a city fixie,
a ['94 forest green Shogun Alpine GT]({{site.url}}/assets/images/bike-selfie.jpg) for touring,
and a middling hard tail aluminum mountain bike I don't know enough about! 

I've cycled down the [West Coast]({{site.url}}/assets/images/ca-coast.jpg) from [Canada to Mexico]({{site.url}}/assets/images/ca-bike.jpg), 
around [Northern Italy and Tuscany]({{site.url}}/assets/images/tuscan-O.JPG), 
and the length of the [Blue Ridge Parkway]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blue-ridge-bike.jpg), from Maryland through North Carolina, 
as well as other shorter tours in between.
