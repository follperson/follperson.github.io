I'm a young professional interested in statistics applied to modern data, especially social networked data.

I am am currently a graduate student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon. I'm studying applied methods and computational tools for modern statistical application, with attention to both data science and traditional statistical applications. I hold a BA in Economics from Oberlin College, and concentrations in psychology, politics and mathematics. I have particular interest in computational methods for social science applications (ABM, network analysis), and Natural Language Processing tasks + computational linguistics. 

Take a look at my [resume]({{ site.url }}{{site.resume-url}}) for more detail from my professional life before that.

I am an everyday cyclist, as well as a cycle tourist when I find the time. I practice Contact Improvisation, enjoy baking breads, and supporting to DIY music shows. 

Feel free to reach out via the contact links under the profile image at the top of the page.
